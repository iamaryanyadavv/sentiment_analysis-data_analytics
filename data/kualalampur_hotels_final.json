I communicated with one of the Glen Cafe\u2019s staff and she wasnt really helpful as her answers for my questions was all jumbled up. Overall, i\u2019d say 3/5."

I admit it was my fault but if there's a staff that did notice and find me, this would not have happened. They simply let the guests park their cars in their premise with very few accountability to protect them from any loss. This is a simple thing even though they have notify this at their parking space, a simple help could mean a lot. No one noticed this. Not even the security guards whose post was quite near to the parking space."

The breakfast was alright not bad, got many choices from unlimited coffee to very delicious nasi lemak. But the hall was too crowded, probably because it was during the weekend - so we had to sit outside which I didn\u2019t mind.

Extra cold room without windows and shower pressure is strong, hot and consistent. Staff is B rating but in a good way meaning they didn\u2019t do anything unpalatable, but they also wont do anything super awesome. You know what I mean? Just basics average in that department which is fine because location is the best of the best. I will stay here again for sure."

Not advisable to stay if you have your own car here, because the hotel does not have its own parking & you have to park at Lot10 or Fahrenheit (RM15/night) and carry your luggage across the busy shopping street. Instead, you can take MRT; the lobby is right in front of Gate 2 MRT Bukit Bintang. Overall very good experience!"

Need to take your shampoo, soap etc. windows very dirt nit allowed us to better enjoy the view. But Definetly a value for money option if you are not looking for simple place to stay"

When you arrive, before parking on the parking lot provided, you need to go to the lobby and take the parking card including the room keys. You can park at the waiting area while doing this. After all settled, you can park your car, take your things, the elevator will go straight to your designated room. The room I took was a 2 bedroom premium, means 1 room with King sized bed (with its own bathroom including a large bathtub) and 1 room with a Queen sized bed. The room's facilities are perfect. You have the cookplace with cookwares, super large refrigerator, laundry with a dryer, high speed fiber broadband wifi, a comfortable sofa on the living room, 2 LCD TVs, and also a side long table on the master bed room for you to place your laptop and do your work. Room service is available everyday, 10AM onwards. You can call the staff if you need any assistance. They will try their best to help you! The main attraction here is the infinity Swimming Pool! You can see from here all the 4 most tallest building in Malaysia (KLCC, KL Tower, TRX and Merdeka 118) on a single panoramic view! Finally, it's the location. Located at the heart of city (Jalan Sultan Ismail), it's near to all tourist attractions including top-notch shopping malls. The price? I can promise you, it's insanely worth it!"

Bathtub can fit 1 adult and 1 kid easily. Bed sheets is also clean. They even provide fork, spoon and also knife. Cutting board also have. The check in check out procedure is easy. The location is also good near Kampung Baru so easy to go eat. I would definitely stay here again as long as they don't increase their price. Hehehe. Overall, definitely 10 out of 10 stars for this."

However the room is spacious, fridge, iron board and TV provided. The resort is facing the lake, gives a nice panoramic view. A walking distance to The Mines Shopping Mall. The restaurant in the resort was not operating during our visit there, so can order from Food Panda or walk to the mall for food. Plus point for those with kids as they can enjoy the pool beach and play with the sand. We enjoy a boat ride at the lake operating from The Mines Shopping Mall. Overall, a pleasant and peaceful stay. Will come back after their full services restored."

Parking was secure, indoor, well lit. RM 5 for 24 hours. 4. Breakfast can be converted to sahur, but had to be notified a day in advance. Cons: 1. Mask wearing was not enforced. Guests in the gameroom weren't wearing masks and even the guard that closed the game room wasn't wearing one. 2. Cleanliness could be improved. Toilet racks were rusted and bedsheets had stains. Rooms that had sofa also had stains on them and that's not a good look. Pull out sofa had crumbs. Elevator buttons were also rusting, but that could be because of reaction with sanitizer. 3. Community kitchen wasn't accessible during sahur. Couldn't use the microwave in the morning at all. Could've made an exception for ramadhan. 4. Can be quite noisy at night as its right beside a highway. All in all, for the price, will probably visit again, but would love for a bit more attention to cleanliness be paid by housekeeping."

The only thing i was not happy is the room is not sound proof from the highway below, i woke up multiple times due to police/ambulance sirens in the middle of the night. If you need a good sleep, i suggest to bring earplug. The self check-in/check-out is easy to use, just make sure you hv your booking ID and personal ID (mykad/passport) ready"

I did expect sachets of coffee or tea bags but it may not have been mentioned when I was booking. Basic hairdryer. Enough space for hanging some clothes and shelves. However, no iron was available and I was too lazy to ask. Also, I brought a medium suitcase but with a larger suitcase, there wouldn\u2019t be much room in the floor to leave it open, esp since we tend to use the suitcases that have items in both sides (hardside luggage). Good sized bed, good linen and pillows and towels were good as well. With a kitchenette I did expect some cutlery and soap for washing said mugs or cutlery. Cleaners do not come to the room unless asked to do I was emptying my takeaway containers on the 1st floor which is a huge space with vending machines as well as another section for washing machines and dryers. Pricey at MYR10 per run for a wash or a dry. Overall, I would stay there again."

Circulation way to enter lift lobby from carpark also very weird, u need to walk up and down staircase due to different levelling.

When using the second machine, proven their system is in error and instead the staff didnot even apologize when he previously blame me due to error. When paying parking also machine didnt return balance, piss-off by the stacking issues, i just left.

I very much enjoyed the bath tub available in the rooms - soaked all my stress away. Facilities: Pretty limited to just a gym, swimming pool and a spa. F&B: Breakfast delivered to the room - quite pricey but the quality of food and beverages were excellent. Service: Hotel staff service was on point - one such example of the excellent service was when I was at the pool swimming and forgot to bring a towel with me. Without even requesting and much to my surprise, two bath towels were brought to my lounge chair. Cons: My one small disappointment I experienced was regarding the flexible check-out time (which was not accommodated) everyone I knew talked about. Would've been great if I could enjoy the facilities a little bit longer. Overall, great accommodation. Will come back if the prices were more reasonable."

It is also located in-between KLCC and Pavilion - not near enough where you can wear 5-inch heels to walk or while carrying 2 suitcases, but near enough to not get drenched in sweat (the walk is sort of uphill). My only suggestions for improvement are to have a mix of thick and thin pillows as I find the overly thin pillows uncomfortable, and the lack of tissues (housekeeping missed this out because the tissue box is inside the drawer and they didn't realise it's finishing - understandable as I don't expect them to stick their hands inside seeing as COVID is still rampant, but perhaps have 2 tissue boxes? One for the living room and one for the bathroom?). Other than these I'm pleased with my stay and would recommend others to stay here again - I would come again myself but I would need to save up for it / wait for a special occasion)."

We didn\u2019t try the restaurants but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s excellent because we saw lots of occupied tables. The room is the one where it will make you not want to leave this place. Complete with full amenities, robes, slippers, Nespresso machine, etc. The beverages in the minibar were provided for guests staying more then 2 nights. The bed and pillows are comfortable but a bit soft for my wife and I. The whole design and aesthetic of the place is very well thought off. The service given by the hotel staffs in The RuMa is impeccable especially the housekeeping and room service people."

I also booked spa slot for my wife. Arrived around 5pm and need to wait a bit. Frontdesk staffs quite busy and a little in stress mood i think. Not really friendly. Is oky. Later when up to my room and i saw no decoration like i asked them to do. Go check at frontdesk and they said no note or remark under myname. Nevermind. Then i ordered room service, popcorn chicken and club sandwich. Popcorn chicken taste like yucky.But club sandwich nice. Breakfast ordered chicken soup wantan and also chicken taste yucky. Then i think overall, not value for money. Just my two cents. But my wife enjoy the spa a lot."

Not even a word could i describe how awful the bed is! One of the hotel staff at the breakfast section should be fired asap!. Bias against local or average looking family. No need for me to explain further. Overall, an unpleasant stay and not worthy for the amount of money that ive paid."

But there's in-room dining where you can choose from 1 out of 3 breakfast set from vege to Malaysian meal set. I've got 2 set of free breakfast since i chose for Free Breakfast package in Agoda. For me eventhough no facilities is open, the location of RuMa itself is good where you can walk to nearest mall (either to Pavillion or KLCC). Bonus point for RuMa is you can have flexi check-in and check out. You have to confirm with the reservation office at least 24 hour before your arrival date if you want to come as early at 1am or to check-out as late as 11pm. Definitely we will come back to RuMa after MCO is over, for us to try facilities offered such as gym, swimming pool and spa :)"

I called the reception 3 times and they don't get what I mean when I asked what type of pillow is available in the menu. The staff even brought the same thin pillow to me after that despite I repeatedly said I want other type of pillow. Also, there are way too many mirrors around that it's scary. For Chinese guests, do take note that there are full-length mirrors facing the bed for suite room. If you wanted to laze in the room and watch TV, take note that there's only AXN, NHK and local channels. Also, the image are blurry too so you might want to cast your own content instead."

I would suggest every cleaner to have a checklist of everything that needs to be done and then tick it off when they have completed the task and this needs to be reviewed when there is a complaint even when they have already ticked off the task. This is just my feedback as i always considered Somerset as a quality stay however with recent observation and experience that i've had, i cannot help but feel slightly disappointed."

We changed rooms 3 times in this visit and nonchalant staffs doesn't seem at all bothered. The first time, the front desk gave us a studio premier instead of the 1 bedroom premier that we paid for. The wrong room is 28% smaller. But I note that the air con in the smaller room is perfectly fine. The second time, there is barely any air from the air conditioning but the staff insist it was ok and told us to wait 1 hour for the air con to be up to speed. Nothing changes after that hour. Went down to the front desk to request a room change again. The third room has the same problem with the air con in the bed room but the living room air con is acceptable. Again the same staff came to check and mention all is ok. When pressed, the staff brought out a tool to measure the air speed from the air con. After not being able to get any reading on the tool, he then proceeds to take the tool apart in an attempt to fix the tool. Not sure if he is not trained to use the tool or the tool is not maintained. Up to this point, everyone is just standing around and is clearly sweating from the heat. Somehow felt sorry for him fumbling with the tool. Since the air con in the living room is acceptable, we will just keep the doors between the rooms open rather than take the trouble of changing rooms again. Yes, we are that easy, so believe me when I say the air con is barely blowing any air. The only reason this hotel is barely acceptable is because it is close to our location of interest in KL. And it is the only hotel in that location. If you don't need to be in Damansara Uptown, please consider another hotel."

The staff either missed housekeeping or never bother to provide the correct number of towels. Have to make multiple request for fresh towels.

Parking was secure, indoor, well lit. RM 5 for 24 hours. 4. Breakfast can be converted to sahur, but had to be notified a day in advance. Cons: 1. Mask wearing was not enforced. Guests in the gameroom weren't wearing masks and even the guard that closed the game room wasn't wearing one. 2. Cleanliness could be improved. Toilet racks were rusted and bedsheets had stains. Rooms that had sofa also had stains on them and that's not a good look. Pull out sofa had crumbs. Elevator buttons were also rusting, but that could be because of reaction with sanitizer. 3. Community kitchen wasn't accessible during sahur. Couldn't use the microwave in the morning at all. Could've made an exception for ramadhan. 4. Can be quite noisy at night as its right beside a highway. All in all, for the price, will probably visit again, but would love for a bit more attention to cleanliness be paid by housekeeping."

Water station is very convenient, the co-living space, kitchen, game room, laundry are all clean and very well managed. The only thing i was not happy is the room is not sound proof from the highway below, i woke up multiple times due to police/ambulance sirens in the middle of the night. If you need a good sleep, i suggest to bring earplug. The self check-in/check-out is easy to use, just make sure you hv your booking ID and personal ID (mykad/passport) ready"

I did expect sachets of coffee or tea bags but it may not have been mentioned when I was booking. Basic hairdryer. Enough space for hanging some clothes and shelves. However, no iron was available and I was too lazy to ask. Also, I brought a medium suitcase but with a larger suitcase, there wouldn\u2019t be much room in the floor to leave it open, esp since we tend to use the suitcases that have items in both sides (hardside luggage). Good sized bed, good linen and pillows and towels were good as well. With a kitchenette I did expect some cutlery and soap for washing said mugs or cutlery. Cleaners do not come to the room unless asked to do I was emptying my takeaway containers on the 1st floor which is a huge space with vending machines as well as another section for washing machines and dryers. Pricey at MYR10 per run for a wash or a dry. Overall, I would stay there again."

The parking machine however is so faulty that it didnt return your balance I was already frustrated because during check up, the system was error at the self check up machine but the staff blame me saying i didnt follow the machine instructions while the problem lies at the machine who unable to accept the room key. When using the second machine, proven their system is in error and instead the staff didnot even apologize when he previously blame me due to error. When paying parking also machine didnt return balance, piss-off by the stacking issues, i just left. The pool as usual is fantastic but if maintenance issues not improved, i dont think i want to come back for another stay."

I understand that they just want to provide 1 TV in in the small living area between the 2 bedrooms but even the sliding doors open the opposite side, not adjacent to the TV. I can't imagine sharing the rooms with friends where only 1 person can sit and watch TV. When my friends come to KL to visit me, I would prefer somewhere to just chill. This place is not it even if the location is fantastic"

And there is a water dispenser near the lift, that's our favourite part of the stay. Just little things that could improve, the hot shower is pretty unstable, turns cold and hot. body wash dispenser is empty. my towel has a huge hole. very few power plugs in the living room area. full body mirror is pretty dirty. but those are just minor issues. overall, we really enjoyed our stay there! will come back to stay again :))"

After check in, in my bedroom still have rubbish from previous client which is empty bottle vitagen, coffee spill at table, and the bed a bit dusty and musty smell.

Then, we had to wait for some time before they changed our room. When we got to the second room, we only managed to put out bags and left for a dinner reception. As we came back.. boom! Aircond issue again and they couldn't do anything about it because no maintenance guy was available. So, we slept in our not so cold room. The next day, they upgrade our room to a better one, yet it was not so. However, the aircond was good to go. So, we just oversee the minor issues with the bathroom (sink pipe was loose, divider sliding mirror was not really sliding, too small toilet sitting area). Also, parking was also charged upon using Touch and Go which many other hotel and suites don't do. We didn't know that before booking. We spent RM 1.60 per hour. Total we spent additional RM60 just for parking. So, I don't think, I will be staying here again and hopefully the management would check their rooms facilities so others would not have to got through the same thing."

Better bigger room and superb service right from even opening the main entrance door for customers. I called the so called Hilton Garden Inn 8 times through their main desk but no one answered. The 2 times someone answered - he redirect me to reservation but no one answered and ending with a machine voice. Long story but will write it to its head office for APAC region. The supervisor is rude on the intercom to my room and even more rude when he came to threaten me with a mere RM250 fine if i am caught smoking. Will be looking at avenue to teach this staff a lesson in service anytime but with a surprise."

Staff was polite and friendly 3. I took a grab so I had no issues with parking but if you have a car it might be tough to find parking ? Unsure. Its a busy area. 4. The rooftop deck was a truly pleasant surprise. Amazing view. 5. Only complaint would be- I was really enjoying the view and ambience of the rooftop bar/lounge but I was denied alcohol! A cold beer would have made it perfect. Why? Cause there was a Private event for a Pre- Buka Puasa shoot. I mean it was a huge open space, I would have been very happy sipping my beer in a tiny corner and would have gladly left upon the arrival of guests. (I wanted to order one hour before the event started). I mean at least inform guests during check in there is a private event. But honestly, I had a really pleasant stay."

Lift is either slow or not enough to cater for too many floors, long wait. Floor uneven at breakfast area, I can obviously feel the shake whenever someone pass by. I will never ever go back again.

As for my gripes, the blanket was literally a piece of thin cloth which really messed with my sleep. My feet were too cold as a result. They also only provide bar soap as opposed to shower liquid, which is not exactly unexpected. Great hotel, might stay again (with my own blanket)."

Iron was provided in every room 7. Good Wifi security, the password only applicable for during our stay 8. Location is good and near to eatery 9. Check in and check out was smooth 10. Low deposit amount, only RM50.00 Cons 1. Very thin blanket, even though we put the aircond with the fan setting and increase the temperature, it was still cold. The blanket is not comfortable at all, felt like wearing a thin layer of singlet. Went to few budget hotels but their blanket were much thicker than this hotel. 2. Washroom was quite dirty along the walls. 3. The room was not really soundproof, can still hear people talk and walk in front of the room (but understandable due to the price paid)"

The lighting panel was confusing but i think its because my age was showing. I would come again."

I very much enjoyed the bath tub available in the rooms - soaked all my stress away. Facilities: Pretty limited to just a gym, swimming pool and a spa. F&B: Breakfast delivered to the room - quite pricey but the quality of food and beverages were excellent. Service: Hotel staff service was on point - one such example of the excellent service was when I was at the pool swimming and forgot to bring a towel with me. Without even requesting and much to my surprise, two bath towels were brought to my lounge chair. Cons: My one small disappointment I experienced was regarding the flexible check-out time (which was not accommodated) everyone I knew talked about. Would've been great if I could enjoy the facilities a little bit longer. Overall, great accommodation. Will come back if the prices were more reasonable."

It is also located in-between KLCC and Pavilion - not near enough where you can wear 5-inch heels to walk or while carrying 2 suitcases, but near enough to not get drenched in sweat (the walk is sort of uphill). My only suggestions for improvement are to have a mix of thick and thin pillows as I find the overly thin pillows uncomfortable, and the lack of tissues (housekeeping missed this out because the tissue box is inside the drawer and they didn't realise it's finishing - understandable as I don't expect them to stick their hands inside seeing as COVID is still rampant, but perhaps have 2 tissue boxes? One for the living room and one for the bathroom?). Other than these I'm pleased with my stay and would recommend others to stay here again - I would come again myself but I would need to save up for it / wait for a special occasion)."

Only complain I have is the check in process took about 30 minutes and I had to pass my credit card + IC to them without supervision. At one point i saw my card and IC was left on the counter without anyone looking after it. Regardless, we had an enjoyable stay."

The bed and pillows are comfortable but a bit soft for my wife and I. The whole design and aesthetic of the place is very well thought off.

Later when up to my room and i saw no decoration like i asked them to do. Go check at frontdesk and they said no note or remark under myname. Nevermind. Then i ordered room service, popcorn chicken and club sandwich. Popcorn chicken taste like yucky.But club sandwich nice. Breakfast ordered chicken soup wantan and also chicken taste yucky. Then i think overall, not value for money. Just my two cents. But my wife enjoy the spa a lot."

Not even a word could i describe how awful the bed is! One of the hotel staff at the breakfast section should be fired asap!. Bias against local or average looking family. No need for me to explain further. Overall, an unpleasant stay and not worthy for the amount of money that ive paid."

But there's in-room dining where you can choose from 1 out of 3 breakfast set from vege to Malaysian meal set. I've got 2 set of free breakfast since i chose for Free Breakfast package in Agoda. For me eventhough no facilities is open, the location of RuMa itself is good where you can walk to nearest mall (either to Pavillion or KLCC). Bonus point for RuMa is you can have flexi check-in and check out. You have to confirm with the reservation office at least 24 hour before your arrival date if you want to come as early at 1am or to check-out as late as 11pm. Definitely we will come back to RuMa after MCO is over, for us to try facilities offered such as gym, swimming pool and spa :)"

The interior was gorgeous and purposeful, I give A+++.The bathroom was gorgeous,with wood feature from top to bottom, the addition of a rain shower made it even more exciting. Only issue was we found a cockroach, probably need a better drain trap and some areas like in the iron cupboard was dusty. The single beds were quite tiny, I'm not very big and I had hardly much room-I should have opted for the king.Beddings were top notch. Would be great if you could provide dishwashing liquid with a sponge so we can wash up since there is a kitchenette as well as a broom for tidying up spills. Also we were disappointed that the pool area was closed at night, we would have loved to get some pictures of the view which is the main reason we chose oasia-as we were given a lower floor Overall, one of the best stays."

I swear they have a top-tier treatment for their guests and that's among the reason why I choose to stay here again. I love how every place is just a walking-distance. Most of the time I just stayed in the room because it was too cozy and relaxing. To Oasia team, you guys are amazing. Will come again, soon!"

There was left over food in front of the lift, and also there was outside the room. People at the opposite room put their leftover outside and it stayed there for way too long it started to smell. At this point it was roughly 19 hour long but luckily it was time for me to check out (I was really curious to see how long it would still be there)."

Both phones stink at the mouth piece and I had to clean and sanitize both units. 2) Housekeeping is done on alternate days. On 1st housekeeping day (3rd day), Housekeeping provided only 1 toilet roll, no kitchen floor mat, 2 small bottles of drinking water, no extra hand towels despite having told Housekeeping on day of check-in, and left a note and tip to Housekeeping on Day 3. 3) For living room, 1 switch for all lights. So either switch on all, or switch off all. At night while watching videos, it was too bright to have living room lights on. Had to switch on balcony light as living room light off."

Took about 15 mins before it was my turn 2) Room remained unchanged. Housekeeping has changed a lot. Only on alternate days will there be housekeeping. Dialed Housekeeping but no one picked up even after several attempts. Had to look for housekeeping staff on my floor to get attention. There was no ironing board, no bath rug, no slippers, etc as I was staying for more than 2 weeks. 3) Was told that half the staff were laid off."

We slept with our rooms\u2019 door opened because of the unpleasant smell. The location is good. Ideal if you want to go for shopping while kids enjoy swimming at the hotel."

The room was simple clean and oh I like the bed. I slept well. The room was well ventilated. It was really great. Worth the money, and the location is perfect because its near to resto, mall and etc. Everything are great in it. Although, I suggest that the bathroom needs more enhancements it looks creepy, wifi not so strong because I experienced choppy line while I was in a meeting virtually. And lastly, the signage of the name of the hotel must bigger. It was not visible, some guests cant see it. But overall, it was an amazing hotel to stay if you are in a tight budget. \ud83d\ude09"

But for me to bring my husband and my kids to this hotel again, I'm think not, because from GF they have 3 lifts but only 1 can use, inside lift look so dark. Until i reach at reception counter. So dark and creepy. Receptionist was okay. Room access card only give 1 no, which is not conveniently because when my husband went to GF to buy snacks, he needs access card to use at elevator. The corridor, omg so dark. My daughter keeps crying because she's afraid of the dark. Inside hotel's room which is i choose view of KLCC, also cannot see clearly because of windows conditions. Im not expecting any more for 3 star hotel but compare to another hotel that also 3 star, i am speechless. It is so scary and not feeling comfortable, i only check in at 9pm, checkout at 11pm on the same day. I'm rather to spend more money for my daughter instead of let my kid spend whole night crying because of not comfortable. Toilets? My husband said like 70s design like slate stone at waterfalls or something. First and last."

Room was pretty dark at night with only lights near bed. Basic toiletries. May I request for a pair of slippers to be included in all rooms. Another snag is no lifts from carpark to lobby hence hotel shd inform guests to drop luggage at the front first before parking otherwise it's a long flight of stairs to lug them all up. Otherwise it's a very decent hotel at a strategic location."

Cititel was known to be the cleanest hotel during my past visits. The hotel management must look into it seriously. Overall, the staff are very helpful and friendly not to forget the maintenance staff. I do really hope that these unpleasant things would not happen again during my next visit."

Nothing beats the convenience of going down the lift and having the mall steps away from the lobby. The room is really nice and clean though a bit on the small side. The best part for me is the water pressure in the shower. If I have any negative point to share, it would be the lack of free parking spaces. I'm fine paying RM15 per entry for parking as I was only staying one night and I spent my time shopping. But if I have other plans which need me to travel to and fro in the future, I will not be staying here."
