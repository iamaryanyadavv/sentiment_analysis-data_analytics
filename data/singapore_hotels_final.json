For me, 64 yrs, when I had some questions all the staff was great with their assistance. Also the IT man (senior) that helped me out with my mobile charge problems. All in all compliments !

Despite calling the front desk and letting them know about this issue, the noises still persisted the next morning. I am very disappointed with this experience. I'm not talking about any noise, it's those noises where staff were laughing and shouting at the top of their lungs. I hope you can tell your staff to be more considerate for the guests in the future. All in all, I would still come back to stay at this hotel."

I thot only one side was sinking... the whole bed was sinking when i sat around to find a comfortable position. Its was a horrible night sleep. The pillow was alrite. My biggest issue is the bed. A hotel is for u to rest. If u are not fussy about a sinking bed and is ok waking up with a backache, by all means this hotel is for u, otherwise, look elsewhere."

The view was great from the 27th floor, and although the room is not as big as what you\u2019d get from other hotels, Yotel made sure that it was a good use of space, and every part of the room was well thought out. The facilities/amenities provided were good (including the free welcome Cocktail), and the only gripe I had was the fact that the bath and the room itself is only separated by a glass panel, and water did leak out to the room itself, it\u2019d have been nice if there was a small slope or step from the shower to the room so that it doesn\u2019t happen though. But otherwise, a fantastic place to stay in, and Orchard Road is just a stone\u2019s throw away. Great location. Will definitely come again!"

The room looks like in a futuristic set up. They call it a cabin. It's kinda tight for a queen sized bed. For travelers who have a back problem like me... The bed is quite soft for support. I guess it's built that way so that it can be bent. There is also no proper table which made it hard for me to do some desk top work. I used the foldable thing built below the tv which also works but not for longer hours. So if u plan to stay there and so some work, it's not a good place. I love the view from the toilet tho!

So we ended giving the majority of our breakfast packs away or throwing them in the rubbish bin. It was really a waste of money. So do not pay for their breakfast! We tried it this time because the website says that cafeteria is now available and we did not realize that breakfast is pre-packed! It was really disappointing! There is also very limited viewing channel thats why this time around we brought our apple device to be able to watch decent films :) Other than the horrible pre packed breakfast and limited viewing option, we actually enjoyed the location, the staff and the hotel itself. That\u2019s why we came back and stayed even longer this time."

Until the8 actually use Mastercard to open the door to ask my wife wake us up as my wife too was locked out cos we overslept when she went out to buy food . I was doing my night shift earlier before checking in. My wife offered to pay for another extension since she knew I was knocked out too tired but next moment she knew they already open the room which I felt theres no privacy. If they think something might have happen my wife is downstairs at their lobby to settle things. So it was a bad experience for me ."

Upon arrival, I was denied checking-in due to the misinformation on Agoda (either one of us had to be at least 21 y/o). Waited for three hours there! I called Agoda, regarding this matter but HGI stood firm on its policy even after Agoda intervened. Later on, HGI CANCELLED my reservation without my acknowledgement. Another appalling thing was that the front desk personnel called Nick, told me that I needed a companion who\u2019s 21 y/o & above to check-in with me and even suggested that I ask a random stranger to check-in with me.

He told us that you have to pay your deposit or you will be not get your room access cards. We told him we have not enough cash at that moment and we dont have a credit card. If a debit card, it will take some time to refund back. He told us to draw cash at any atms nearby. So, we did. Then, when we came back with the cash, we saw a very long line of queue at the reception. We approached him and he told us to queue again. And we waited in line for more than half an hour.

He also gave us tips on where to get a good local breakfast and the best place to get local currency. The room was spacious enough for a couple. The bed was amazingly comfortable. Location wise, it is perfect to experience the local culture. Surrounded by plenty of delicious food stalls. The staff was always very attentive to your needs. Kudos to Isa, Issam, Fithri and the Hilton Garden Inn Team. HIghly Recommended and definitely will be back."

I had an issue with the curtains when I checked in and a technician arrived to sort it within about 10 mins - excellent service. The only one issue was that I had requested a quiet room; I appreciate it's not always possible to accommodate these requests, but my room was in the Serangoon Tower, right at the end so virtually backed on to the very busy, often noisy main road. Definitely not a quiet room but overall I still enjoyed my stay."

The lady who did the housekeeping should be rewarded. Further, the location is very convenient. Not in the busy centre of little india, and only 2 mins walk to MRT. 5 mins walk to Mustafa center and so many food options around the hotel. The best thing is, this hotel got a 7-11. So you are saved even you forgot something in the middle of the night. Definitely, this will be my stay in Singapore if I needed to stay somewhere close to little india."

Third day morning 7am the housekeeper press our door bell when i open the door the staff said their system stated we have check-out. I told him we have not yet check-out. But the nightmare not yet end. 9am the housekeeper again come and press our door and said the system states we have check-out. I reply the same.

Not a single number flashed on the screen after 20mins but I see the Q moving. Asked the staff again and said to wait for the number again. My autistic son was already restless at thay time. Myself and another guest were frustrated & gave up and queued. We were served normally. Informed the staff but they were just so focused on clearing the Q without acknowledging the issue.

For the amount charged, I felt the additional touches from a service perspective was missing. There was no complimentary drink/fruit to welcome us (no, the mask, sanitizer and wet tissue doesn\u2019t really count\u2026 does it?), much less a welcome kit with some information that would have been useful for a first time guest. There were no bathrobes or coffee machine. There wasn\u2019t even a menu for room service. When we called the reception and asked about halal options nearby they only mentioned McDonalds. When we ordered through Foodpanda our rider was told bikes weren\u2019t allowed in so we had to walk to B1 in the adjoining building to pick up the food - an information that would have been nice to know so we could help navigate our delivery contact. I wish the room came with at least a bathtub to make up for the sad view of the canopy blocking any signs of life or energy. The swimming pool unfortunately didn\u2019t make up for it with it\u2019s dismal size with not much of a view too. All in all, it wasn\u2019t a bad stay per se. It just felt lacking in the special touches which is a shame given it\u2019s proximity to tourist attractions. It\u2019s not even trying to keep up with newer competition. It\u2019s the little touches that\u2019ll make the stay seem value-for-money and Hotel Michael is in need of a customer service intervention if it hopes to survive longer."

The expected wait is about 2 hours. They have an option to do self check in, but these machines just do not recognise the booking reference or NRIC and I could not use them. It is surprising that a hotel that is in operation for 11 years have not been able to streamline this process. When I reached the reception counter, I was told that no non-smoking rooms were available for the Deluxe Suites that I had booked. After some discussion , they upgraded me to a bigger suite , which was very generous of them. My stay itself was very comfortable and relaxing. The breakfast was limited, especially for vegetarians like me and my family, but the staff at the restaurant were understanding and provided us with a couple of options. For a 5 star Hotel they could offer some fruits and non alcoholic to the guests , but the rooms are bare. The suite I stayed in had a kitchen, but there was no cutlery - no plates, no spoons, ladles and bowls for utilising the kitchen. Finally , another feedback on housekeeping. One of the bathroom doors was stuck . When we called maintenance, one person came and said that he needs another person to come and help. On the 3rd day , when we checked out , the door was still not repaired. We had to lock the bedroom door to use the bathroom. Other than the above the stay was comfortable and relaxing."

After registering for check in, room were not issued and we need to wait an hour more for keys to be issued at another counter. Very confusing and frustrating check in process. Room were great and spacious, was given the last room of the aisle near exit but far away from lift no complaints on this. What compensated were the room after a whole day out. Didn\u2019t get pool slots at all couldn\u2019t comment, breakfast weren\u2019t fantastic not much choices only 1 western and 1 local for selection. Other than that thankful for the short walk after a tired full day at uss."

I am very sad that as a local I cannot say that I am happy with the way the hotel staff handle the situation. There are only 2 staff serving the hotel guests and check in was delayed for a least 2 hours. As our hotel stay comes with breakfast, the guest can only order their set meal for breakfast which is understandable during this period. However I would like the management to seriously review to the standard of the breakfast. This is not my first staycation at Sentosa and I had stayed in other Hotels in Sentosa. To compare the breakfast with the other hotels in Sentosa, I am surprised to share that the breakfast provided by Hotel Michael was way below standard. With my experience at Hotel Michael, I am certain that I won't be going back there a second time. On the whole I am disappointed with the service as well as the breakfast menu."

Kudos to them. Hotel management should be there at frontdesk to help. Hotel is basic. Small pool so book your swimming slots early. Room was basic with no items in mini bar. Shower amenities provided. Good super single beds and thick towels. Nightshift auntie (7 dec evening) and guy (8 dec evening) was kinda rude. Otherwise, friendly staff overall. Location is excellent but note that most shops closed on mons to weds including USS. Good basic hotel but stay only during off peak as hotel is very understaffed. Do not expect luxury."

They forgot our order and we waited more than 20min till we notice the table beside us receive their order (they ordered the same item as us) even though we are there much earlier. When food is served, we notice that we are missing several food item from the breakfast set (grilled tomato, ham, bacon etc) and the egg choice is wrong as well. What puzzled us is how did they serve us the food with 3 item missing and did not realize it since it is part of standard menu. Told the staff and he changed it for us, only to bring out wrong item again. All in all, our food item is wrong served 3 time. Their poached egg is also cold like it been left in the aircon for quite some time as well as overcooked (like hard boiled egg). Their tea and juice is also very diluted. Only good thing we can think of is their staff brought us the beer can opener at night time when we called their front desk and request for it."

We requested a baby cot the next day and thanks to the staff for arranging it as previously was told the room was quite crowed if they were to put a baby cot in. Thanks to the housekeeping staff as well to change the bed sheet when requested due to certain reason. It was a pleasant n great stay for us there.

Next day room cleaning very late and doing it very fast by not paying attention of setting beds and putting ckeaning of used coffee cups etc. Order room service of food take more than half hourbfor getting one fried noodle plate. Morning break fast many showing sign board of food but when open it found hot warer only. Coffee water is not hot and no one taking care at breakfast area. Asked for morning call first day staff said we forgot due to mistake of our new staff. Not worth at all for paying money with family trip. How they are showing 4 stars it should show 3 stars hotel."

Marina Bay precinct can be accessed with a 20 minute walk. That's kind of where the good part ends. This is an obviously older and now quite tired hotel. The facilities were adequate, but the room was tired but adequate. Dining in the restaurant was extremely disappointing for one evening meal we had there (seafood buffet), and the breakfast was adequate, but nothing more. I would suggest that this hotel is a relatively cheap option if you don't intend to spend any time in the hotel other than sleeping, and that you dine elsewhere."

Firstly there were stairs right when you reach the entrance and no one was there to assist you life your luggage up. I was only offered assistances when I reach the front desk which was obviously too late. Recep was not friendly at all. She did not even give a smile. Another guest interrupted but she clearly did not speak English and she seemed like like lost her bag. But instead of offering help, Recep have her a look of disgust. Like she couldn\u2019t be bothered. She just replied with a \u201chuh? What? no no no. I don\u2019t know.\u201d And went on with doing her staff. She then handed me over to another Recep. A younger male who seemed new or maybe just reserved. Seemed nervous. She kept on telling him what to do and what room to give me. Spoke in Chinese infront of me which to me was offensive. If you need to speak in private pull him aside instead of just telling him across the front desk in another language. Someone else could have assumed that they were talking about them. So it is definitely not nice at all. Room was old and dated. Bedsheet Had some stains on it. I called for ice. Remember I\u2019m paying $400 for one night. I was then told that a bucket of ice would cost $5. I\u2019ve never been charged for ice so to me this was absurd given the price I was paying and this was not a budget hotel. Pushed one of the beds to the corner as I needed more space and lo and behold, dust and rubbish were found. Clearly they have not swept or vacuumed under the bed for years. Lift was also old and slow. There were different buttons for different lifts. So that was confusing too. All in all, totally not worth the price. Not a very pleasant experience too. Very much disappointed and a total waste of $400."

We like Velu very much (the concierge) Nice room, spacious enough but the twin bed is small for me and my child (age 9), so if you bring children and want to stay in 1 room, you have to order additional bed for the comfy nice sleep. Definitely will recommend this hotel to may friends and family. Keep up the good work!"

There was some enamel coming off in the bath but we werent bothered by that.

I handed my credit card to the lady staff when a deposit was required. She processed the transaction but however, a male staff completed the transaction & returned my card instead. I thought it was strange that she didn't return my card herself. I think it is important that the same person who handled a customer's card should be the one to return back to the customer as this would prevent an error in returning to a wrong customer. Finally, did she wish me a pleasant stay in the hotel? I didn't expect any but it would have made my day if she did."

Let's go through the good points first. 1) Room was a bit more spacious than I expected, with the toilet quite generous. More importantly, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. 2) Even though there wasn't a refrigerator, staff was kind enough to offer a solution which was to place it in a common refrigerator and retrieve it later. Now, the not so good points. 1) The reception is always busy. 9 times out of 10, nobody picks up my call. And I wasn't calling at the peak period (i.e. check in check out timing) either. 2) I understand that parking is not included, and that was made clear when I asked the staff. Staff mentioned that there is a max charge of $15. Imagine my shock when I was charged almost double of that. I'm not sure if a coupon was needed to get that flat rate or not, but I wasn't offered and it was implied to me that per entry, that was the maximum I'll be charged and that it'll be automatic. It's not a large amount but it sure left a sour taste in my mouth. Overall, it's not too bad, a little pricey but maybe don't come when they're busy."

We arrived on a peaked Saturday with lots of occupants in the line for check in, time took about 20mins with 3 counter staff, considered pretty fast. Staffs were very polite and efficient, everything was smooth and made easy. The promo comes with a room upgrade so we default had an King\u2019s room which is adequately sufficient for couples, not a big room but it\u2019s modernly furnished. In the center of Bugis, there\u2019s plenty of food and location to roam about. Then comes the morning breakfast burgers and fries, it was delicious. Check out time was also shifted to 2pm as part of the package, that was hard to miss for any staycation. Overall an very worthy bang for buck promotion, I would at least minimum recommend an King size room thou if you can\u2019t stand small rooms. Another drawback would be the lift which is only one that serves all occupants."

There is a 711 right across the street infront of the hotel. There is a local Indian restaurant nearby that opens till late. Hotel is located in between 2 rather city-like districts, Bugis and Bencoolen/Selegie which is close to Dhoby Ghaut. Both places require some around 15 minutes of walking."

It amazes me how people who are supposed to be in the hospitality industry and for an industry that relies so much on word of mouth for its business ruin everything for something as trivial as water. anyway, i was already put off by this absurd interaction and promptly proceeded to check out. the lady at the reception(who was wearing black suit) didn't say anything and let her hand out as if expecting me to hand over something to her. i asked what she wanted, and she couldn't understand me. she could have said what she wanted (the access card) instead of the dehumanising gesture she made. an absolutely appalling end to what would have been a great stay. there were no words exchanged as I handed her the cards and walked out after staying from the 28th august to 1 sep. advice to the management: politeness is a very strong currency and gives rich dividends in the long run."

They even provide us a free upgrade to a larger room during National Day! *Feedback on Room and Amenities* Our room in Summer View Hotel is quite clean with rather new furnishing. Their shower amenities are great - the shower's water pressure is strong and could easier change between hot and cold water which you could prefer which is very useful fir shower. However, it would be recommendable for Summer View Hotel to provide a box of tissues or packets of tissues in each hotel room so hotel guests need not use the toliet papers instead... The flat pillows in the bed would be advisable to change to fluffier ones or double up the flat pillows to prevent the hotel's guests from having a sore neck or shoulder aches from sleeping on it. Likewise, the sound proofing between rooms and walls (facing the street roads) could be improved via adding foam walls to prevent hearing noises from neighbouring rooms (especially when our neighbours are having a birthday party) or the motorcycles on the road speeding past at night, for hotel guests to acquire a more pleasant sleeping and resting experiences. *Feedback on Hotel's Location* Location wise is good, as food and shopping could be easily found and done with lots of convenient stores, hawker centres and local small malls around. Overall rating: Summer View Hotel is reommended and price-friendly (valuable) for a short-term stays."

However, it seem the breakfast will be the same for the 5 days. The hotel also won't clean the room everyday which is fine with us. Overall, I enjoyed my stay here and highly recommend this hotel"

Room clean but during this time, there will be no room cleaning service. But you can always asked for more linens and towels. No swimming pool as it was closed due to upgrading i guess. Breakfast included in the booking but food selection was just ok. Nothing fancy. Some of it too salty (eg fried rice and the vermicilli). Good location of the hotel as many eateries nearby."

Although all of us had filled in & submitted all our personal details & documents, reception still took our id/passports upon checking in. Defeats the purpose of filling up the forms isn\u2019t it? The rooms lack amenities. Facilities like gym & pool were closed. One of our rooms had maggot/worm crawling on the bedsheet. When we notified the hotel staff, all they can say was - \u201cwe apologise, perhaps the windows were opened earlier\u201d. Nothing else was offered to make up for the maggot incident! Long queue for breakfast too. Service staff at the restaurant were mostly rude. Given that the crowd was overwhelming, Royal Plaza\u2019s standard has dropped tremendously. Maybe the pandemic has put many service industry staff in slumber but with business going back to normal, there is a need to do more to attract customers."

However our tiredness & frustration was overcome with the sincere apologies and awesome hospitality of the receptionist, Ms Seri. This made our stay awesome!

Give it a try eventhough pool & gym under maintenance and here I am queuing for an hour to check in. Fail from the start of the service process. Breakfast at Carousel, service at the omelette and pancakes station was unsatisfactory (27th Feb Sun morning). And long queue again. Very disappointed and upsetting. 1) The management should look into the process of handling high volume of occupants on every weekends (set up a monile check in counter etc). 2) Service should also be improve, perhaps a proper training. 3) They should not panicked when serving high volume of people. 4) The fruit station staff told me to WAIT while he finish his chores of mixing some fruit mix yoghurt (i dont know whats the stuff he is Overall, the food was alright but the service here does not justify for the price we pay for the hotel. Compare to my previous pleasant visit, i must say this worse. Even my japanese colleague was taken aback. And lastly, the operator says they DO NOT have housekeeping service due to surge in omicron cases. I can request for change of towels and they will send it to me. I stayed for 2 days. I can\u2019t imagine if I stay for a week and there is NO housekeeping. After so many years of staying in a hotel, this is my first time experiencing such a service. I am not asking for anything more than just a basic hotel needs. After reading this review, i believed you can feel my frustration. Just so glad that tomorrow is checking out day.

Checking in was fast . can\u2019t argue with the price because the experience, the facilities , room , cleanliness is well done . Don\u2019t mind paying if the experience is like this . The breakfast buffet at Carousel was amazing , the food is a must to have , the staff was very attentive and also very helpful , very well dress , cleanliness is tip-top. Nothing to not like about everything. Location is the best . Thank you for making my stay a pleasant experience and most memorable one and thank you to all the working staff . good job and please stay safe \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc"

Check-in process is efficient even though there is big weekend crowd. Likewise, another long queue for breakfast over weekend, but the staff managed this crowd well. For those with young children and especially thinking of staycation - the swimming pool size would be big disappointment. Also, there are NO KIDS CHANNELS on TV and NO other amenities like Children play rooms etc. Few other letdowns are the stains on bedsheets, much-hyped 'free bar' that comes with 2 bottles of water and 2 small cups of juice, no towels near pool, gym with half of the equipment under maintenance. The room given to us doesn't have any view, but the hotel is in city centre - so can't complain much. Positives are hotel's central location, reasonable price, good breakfast spread and superb staff in restaurant ."

The staff also was giving faces when we were unhappy about the unorganised way, which was wrong for them to do so as a cso. They can work on the check in and the safe entry for a better experience.

They mentioned i requested for twin bed room and whole hotel only have 1 twin room available. Well... The view of the hotel facing a big construction site. Since i was at the 7th floor , there's no view but facing a big construction site. Breakfast order, i couldnt choose any. Was told that everyone in the hotel will be having the same breakfast order we were only offered to choose the juice but when we went to collect the breakfast we heard someone else saying they chose scrambled eggs which we did not have any scrambled eggs at all. So there were choices but we werent told any. Went down to collect apparently there's some mixing up of the breakfast orders and we waited for awhile for our breakfast. Lastly, i mentioned i booked the room to celebrate my friend's birthday, there were nothing at all. Of course i understand that compliments were subject to hotel's availability again isnt it? But this is the only hotel i been to where i mentioned about celebrating someone's birthday and nothing is done. Amazing. When we want to book the pool timing. We werent told that we need to go front office to get the key pass. I mean some information should be told at the reception and probably talk abt the breakfast order too isnt it? Luckily the room was clean. Yeap. That's my honest review for the hotel."

Im not unreasonable kind of guest, i can wait but half an hour without any update to me its unfair. Already checking in time is 3pm...by the time half hour, i can do lots of things. At least if there's a delay, do update the guest by the time its 15min of waiting. There's a few guests stranded waiting to check in at the lobby. On good side, the amenities were good."

As for reception wise, no one seems to pick up the phone at anytime (tried calling 3x at different timing, you will hear advertisements throughout), good luck.. During check in, receptionist gave us instructions on how to do self collection of breakfast in the morning. Next morning when we are down, was told no breakfast on Sunday.. hmm.. Also, was given set of instructions to log into hotel WiFi, no surprise, the password don\u2019t work, feels like reception not the most professional though.. Room wise, would appreciate if speaker could allow connectivity to Bluetooth, it is still the kind of manual connector for iPhone 4 series? Also TV is still connected to DVD player, not the most user friendly. Overall decent room for the price we pay. Just don\u2019t expect any response from anyone after check in."

I am a super light sleeper and had a terrible night sleeping as the FCU was radiating a super low frequency which is amplified at the bedhead level. I had to sleep in 90deg orientation from the bedhead in order not to hear the low humming noise from the living room to the bedroom. Overall a very bad night for me as the low humming noise interrupted a supposedly a good night rest for me. Nonetheless the bed and pillows were good.

They did take our ICs for documentation so yeah. I mean, not even a birthday greeting. Hahaha so I was really disappointed because I decided to celebrate my birthday there and they did not go \"the extra mile\". I didn't want that to ruin my stay so I just tried to forget about it. Probably do better next time. Also, the room wasn't in good condition - one of the freezer's drawers was broken; we found plastics in the dining area cabinet (probably from previous guests); appliances are really slow.

The apartment was very generously sized, with a big sitting room and decently sized kitchen for long stays. The pool access was restricted to 1 hour per guest, up to 8max at a time. I generally had the pool to myself or shared with 2 to 4 others. The water is quite chilly maybe because it's a rooftop pool. The amenities provided were good. There was some wear and tear on the furnishings, but otherwise the room was fine."

The views from the living room, bedroom and pool is amazing! Their service was impeccable too. We very very impressed from start to end of the staycay and are still reminiscing on the experience. Wanted to need our stay to an additional night but they were fully booked out. This is now our new go to place when we are craving for a staycay. Not to miss us the price point which makes it lesser than hotel yet so much more to offer. Thanks for the unforgettable experience @panpacfic serviced suites Beach Road."

One thing I feel disappointed at is the hotel has no service to take care of sending small package by air courier. When I asked a hotel staff for help, he flatly declined my request and just told me to go to a nearby post office in a very unpleasant attitude. It seemed to me that he was not interested to take care of anything which exceed his regular service. This attitude is totally different from that of 4 or 5 stars class hotels.

We were given two doubles so for the first night I shared with my daughter my husband with our son, not really a big issue they were unable to move us as the hotel was full but the next day they were able to accommodate our request for the remainder of our stay. The hotel was very clean, staff were extremely helpful couldn't do enough for us, breakfast was varied and plentiful. The rooftop area was an added bonus, they allowed us to use the showers up there as we had to check out at noon but wasn't flying until the evening so we showered and changed Before leaving for the airport. This hotel is very good value for money and see little point in paying top price for hotels when this one is so excellent. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable we loved Singapore too!"

Not a big deal if you don't mind walking and have an extra 5 - 10 mins. For my personal travel I'd rather a quirky boutique in Little India at this price point, but for business it's pretty perfect."

Despite calling the front desk and letting them know about this issue, the noises still persisted the next morning. I am very disappointed with this experience. I'm not talking about any noise, it's those noises where staff were laughing and shouting at the top of their lungs.

I thot only one side was sinking... the whole bed was sinking when i sat around to find a comfortable position. Its was a horrible night sleep. The pillow was alrite. My biggest issue is the bed.

The view was great from the 27th floor, and although the room is not as big as what you\u2019d get from other hotels, Yotel made sure that it was a good use of space, and every part of the room was well thought out. The facilities/amenities provided were good (including the free welcome Cocktail), and the only gripe I had was the fact that the bath and the room itself is only separated by a glass panel, and water did leak out to the room itself, it\u2019d have been nice if there was a small slope or step from the shower to the room so that it doesn\u2019t happen though. But otherwise, a fantastic place to stay in, and Orchard Road is just a stone\u2019s throw away. Great location. Will definitely come again!"

The room looks like in a futuristic set up. They call it a cabin. It's kinda tight for a queen sized bed. For travelers who have a back problem like me... The bed is quite soft for support. I guess it's built that way so that it can be bent. There is also no proper table which made it hard for me to do some desk top work. I used the foldable thing built below the tv which also works but not for longer hours. So if u plan to stay there and so some work, it's not a good place. I love the view from the toilet tho! Dint have the chance to experience Yoshi and Yolanda but I guess you guys should check it out! They're cute robots! \ud83d\ude0d"

But when I had problems with my room, they can suddenly offer late checkout by 1 hour for compensation. It is difficult to get foods at night after 10 as there are no halal restaurants nearby."

It\u2019s unbearable. Very hard to request for room change, excuse that they give is the room capacity is high and also they won\u2019t give you late check out, swimming slot is only available at 11am and end at 12pm at that time when I book, they die2 won\u2019t allow for late check out, very unreasonable, very stingy, very calculative, they don\u2019t try to accommodate to your needs. When open the cupboard there\u2019s a very strong smelly smell comes out of it. Breakfast in the morning, at the restaurant floor there\u2019s a lizard which was still alive and moving. We can\u2019t enjoy our breakfast. Definitely not gonna bring my family nor will I recommend this hotel to anyone else, it\u2019s really not worth it. There\u2019s more nicer hotel in Singapore that we can enjoy with our family. That\u2019s all."

They should have waited patiently for me to end my call. When I arrived at my hotel room, I was horrified as the entire room was So Dusty. I understand that due to covid, the rooms might have been vacant for quite some time but the hotel did not even bother to clean-up the room first before allowing new guest to stay & check-in. It was really disappointing and as a result, I had sensitive nose thru out my stay as I was allergic to dust. I have evidence on how dusty the room is everywhere if you need the evidence as proof."

We called to request to change our room and was quite fortunate that they did the room change for us. The new room was the same as the previous room just that the TV was quite small for a 5 star hotel. The bed was good and pillow was one of the best that i have slept on across all my visits to the hotels in Singapore. The breakfast is worth a skip as the western corner scrambled eggs was hard, hash brown was hard and oily, croissant is not crispy only the asian selection of fried bee hoon with seemingly CP chicken drumlets was not bad. overall for the price paid, i could have gone to somewhere else instead."

It's not very pleasant stay as I have kids and I was so paranoid so I have to keep on spraying disinfectant in the room and all the surfaces. I hope hotels should at least designated floors for VTLs. The feeling was not so good when you came out the room and what you are seeing were all rooms next to you have pack of foods hanging on their door knobs.

Our fears were fortunately unfounded! Something must have happened behind the scenes because the check-in experience for us was really smooth! The room itself was comfortable and the provided cot was invaluable in making sure our lil' one doesn't hurt herself for when we need our hands free to do stuff. I want to also make special mention of The Capital dinner crew that was on shift in the evening of the 28th of Dec. My wife and I felt at home because some of the crew (I remember the bartender who came by and spoke with us which was nice) was very attentive to our needs (providing high chair, picking up stuff dropped on the floor by the baby e.g.). The only slight drawback for us is that there wasn't any convenience store nearby and we were out of snacks. The places around here to grab a bite ain't cheap!"

We have a total of 4 rooms and my family went to the hotel at 4.30pm but the lobby was full and there was a long queue. The hotel staff told them that the check in process will take about 2hrs and they were told to go to go up for a drink in the function room. At about 4.30pm, I and husband arrived in our wedding outfit. At 5pm, we get to register at the reception but the rooms were not ready and we were told to go up again for a drink as our rooms will be ready in about 2 hrs. At around 7pm we went to the reception again and the lobby was still full. We approach the counter to ask about our rooms but no rooms were available because there was shortage of linens. We asked to meet the manager. The receptionist approaches us and told us that the manager will see us in a while but the manager DID NOT meet us at all. We were practically begging them to give us 1 room for me (the bride) to change out of my heavy wedding dress so that we can go out for dinner. Fortunately, at about 8pm we manage to get help from Claudia she offered us 1 room for us to change. After changing out of my wedding dress (wore the dress for 12hrs was a nightmare) we went out for dinner. At around 10pm, on the way back, I called the hotel to ask if our rooms were ready and I was put on hold for so long and guess what? 1 room was still not ready and by that time, I was already so tired and frustrated. When we came back to the hotel, we were greeted again by Claudia. She was very apologetic and she managed to get all our rooms ready. She apologized and upgrades us (the wedding couple) to the club floor. We were told that a honeymoon arrangement was waiting for us but when we enter the room, we were disappointed again. Nothing was prepared but we were fine as we are already so tired. Room was very dated and dusty. There\u2019s also lots of trash on the corridor and it was not cleared for 3 days. We stayed 3 days and 2 night"

Told that we were #15 in queue and it'd take 1.5 hour for our room to be ready. We were given the option of late check out (which we can't utilise as we have elsewhere to be) or a welcome drink each (we sure didn't feel welcomed with the check-in process). The check-in staff we dealt with was polite and apologetic, but it didn't help that we were shortchanged of 3 hours of our stay, as our room was indeed only ready around 6pm. This staycay was for my boyfriend's birthday, but we had to wait around wasting time and he napped on the chair by the reception while I read Google reviews about similar or worse waiting times at this hotel (just look at the latest Google reviews; those abt their recent stays were all 1-star reviews due to the check-in wait). It is not worth the amount we paid and certainly we could have spent our time better had we known prior to arrival that our room was not ready. It is unbefitting a 5-star hotel to provide such service. If the hotel doesn't have enough housekeeping manpower, it should have just accepted fewer bookings! Room: Spacious and comes with a bathtub, but really need a renovation as the bath fittings look outdated and worn. Water drained from both taps very slowly. Lighting in the main area by the bed was too dim. Wardrobe door kept opening by itself which triggered the sensor light inside and had to try many times to make it stay closed. Corridor to rooms very dated. Facilities: Didn't even get to use the swimming pool as we can only book when we are assigned a room number, but as mentioned, we only got our room at 6pm and the pool closes at 7pm! We called a few times to try to secure a slot but not surprisingly, it was fully booked. We can only view the pool from our room. The pool opening hours could have extended to late at night to accommodate the number of pool users sinc"

The guy checking us in were not apologetic for the long waiting time, no form of compensation was given, he flatly said check out was at 11am the next day and he said long waiting check in queue was out of his control. 5* hotel with poorer service than a 3* boutique hotel to be honest. After finally checking in, first step into the room was welcomed with a moldy smell, room was very dim, we on all the lights but they were dim orange lights and felt only half of the room was lit. Toilet seat was stained with urine from previous guest. Eww? Dust was collecting on the counters above the bathtub. There was a mini fridge, and a bottle of half drank soft drink from the previous guest was still left inside it. What can I say? Apparently cleanliness and hygiene definitely not 5* standard. We gave up using the mini fridge which wasn\u2019t even cold anyways. We booked the deluxe king room for 2 pax, but amenities were for 1 pax? There was only 1 bathrobe, 0 room slippers, missing shampoo. Had to call room service to request for missing items. Mind u, we waited for more than 30mins only to have to call again cause nothing was delivered. We ordered GrabFood for dinner and there were no disposable cutlery given, (although not the hotel fault), we tried calling room service if they could provide us with cutlery, and again we waited this time at least 45mins before calling AGAIN to see if it was instead possible to collect the cutlery at the counter ourselves cause we gave up waiting. 5* service? Haha. Also, since we booked the room with breakfast, the check in guy told us last order at the buffet breakfast place at level 1 was 9.30AM and cancelled the 10.30AM written on the check in slip, so we went down around 9AM the next morning, only to see people still streaming in at 9.30-10AM AND the buffet counters were still opened.

I thought sound proofing in hotels were good but it is proven wrong. As it stopped, I did not call for assistance. 4) Too many people at the lobby waiting to check-in or checking-in.

The ground floor lobby where the check~in counter and concierge is more like a public thorough fare where all kind of people are there ie, those visiting the casino, those visiting the linked sandy Bay mall, tourists and local alike who just wanna drop in to see the place. Not sure if it is due to current pandemic, it is such a pain that each time to take the lift to go up the room u need to announce your room number and all the occupants names for the \"gatekeeper\" to register into his laptop and likewise when you exit the lift...

While the view from the room was spectacular (granted that you book rooms at the higher level), there is room for improvement for the staff service. The staff service was rather inconsistent, with a small handful of hotel staff providing excellent service and majority of the hotel staff providing mediocre service. The only memorable service received was when the receptionist managed to squeeze us in for a slot for the infinity pool. We had a not so good experience when we were given inconsistent message regarding utensils request. At first they told us it was chargeable if we request for more than a dozen of utensils. When we clarified with the receptionist during our check-out, she said that requesting for utensils is not chargeable at all, regardless of number of utensils requested. Quite inconsistent in the message given... Most of the staff there were also quite unenthusiastic, not the kind of service level I was expecting from MBS. Perhaps it is because of the high volume of Singaporeans doing staycation there?"

The infinity pool is the cherry on the top however, due to covid-19, it\u2019s access is limited to an hour and you have to book it in advance. You are force to vacate after the given slot as they clean the facilities (sunbeds, tables, etc) and prepare it for the next slot. It feels restricting but gives you security as well that everything has been cleaned and safe. In room food is quite pricey but delish!"

But if you don't travel and only stay locally, MBS is slightly above average. Location, convenient enough since it's right next to the bayfront mrt and walking distance to the attractions such as gardens by the bay,shopping malls etc. Facilities were okay, shower head was a little rusty but it was plastic, not sure what's happening there. The table beside the bed was dusty AF, just happened to drop my child's milk bottle behind it and dust was literally flying everywhere. Balcony facing the gardens by the bay was nice but floor was dirty and took the grand out of the view a little. Skypark was the worse. View was mediocre at best. Maps that were printed in multiple languages at the viewing areas were peeling off, signs were faded due to rain or sun. Apparently maintenance took a day off here. Value for money? I paid around 600 for one night, quite affordable for a hotel of this calibre but I definitely would not consider it value for money. If it was heavily discounted, I might recommend MBS, other than that, you're better off elsewhere. Unless you're filthy rich and have no concept of money. Staff fortunately was the saving grace for this entire endeavour. Pleasant, polite and helpful."

As a result you either you either have to go wake up Super early to try your luck with their lousy Q system or wait until late before you can even know if you can come up to swim. No complimentary parking for hotel guests. Ridiculous check out timing at 1100hrs. Staffs were not accommodating in any way. Seems like they only pay attention to their VIPs and disregard everyone else. All in all, MBS is nice to look at but not the best to stay in if you\u2019re in Singapore.

While booking it was never mentioned that breakfast is pre-packed. The breakfast was non edible and mostly stone cold when delivered at our door. So we ended giving the majority of our breakfast packs away or throwing them in the rubbish bin. It was really a waste of money. So do not pay for their breakfast! We tried it this time because the website says that cafeteria is now available and we did not realize that breakfast is pre-packed! It was really disappointing! There is also very limited viewing channel thats why this time around we brought our apple device to be able to watch decent films :) Other than the horrible pre packed breakfast and limited viewing option, we actually enjoyed the location, the staff and the hotel itself. That\u2019s why we came back and stayed even longer this time."

Until the8 actually use Mastercard to open the door to ask my wife wake us up as my wife too was locked out cos we overslept when she went out to buy food . I was doing my night shift earlier before checking in. My wife offered to pay for another extension since she knew I was knocked out too tired but next moment she knew they already open the room which I felt theres no privacy. If they think something might have happen my wife is downstairs at their lobby to settle things. So it was a bad experience for me ."

But they gave a very small cake with a \"Happy anniversary\" sign on top of it...my sister just got married. What anniversary? But appreciate the effort. It's an old hotel despite 5-star, I'd recommend this hotel if they've undergone renovations to upgrade their looks and facilities. Other than that, no major problem or anything fancy about our stay."

We only wished the gym opened to later than 7pm so we could exercise after our heavy meals. Our room was facing Marina Bay Sands and we woke up to good view every morning. The hotel is across the street from Chijmes and Raffles City, Suntec and Funan are just a couple minutes away. (No worry about food or lack of places for after meal walks or shopping!!) During our stay, we even did quiet morning walks to Chinatown and Telok Ayer! We didnt book breakfast with the hotel, but plenty of options and good food available everywhere. Bathroom was big with a bathtub. The hotel was also really sweet to offer us complimentary cake for our anniversary! It was a really great stay and we'll be back again for staycay in the future :)"

We're paid for the breakfast buffet price. Although it's able to unlimited order but is not worth for the price. The nasi lemak is not very nice. And the america breakfast's bacon super hard. And the breakfast set menu is not much of choice. For their staff service is quite good except the last day we stayed. We're waiting to order our breakfast for quite long. And called one of their staff he said one minute will come back to us. But end up I went to look for other staff to order my food. Except the breakfast others is good."

We stayed for a good 4 days 3 night. On the last day, they cancel our wifi. Haha lol i mean you can cancel our wifi after we check out right? We had issues with the door too. We couldn\u2019t scan the card on our door. So imagine after swimming i had to go back down to the counter and get the card issue fixed. That\u2019s all! Thank you for reading \ud83d\ude03"

When my wife requested to change the room with another receptionist, that receptionist also replied in very angry and rude way. Furthermore, he told my wife that he don\u2019t understand her English, that made us felt really bad. Fortunately, we eventually got help from a nice manager to change our room to a nicer one.

We came here for the pool, but on the day of our check-in the agent told me the pool is not available. I email them in advance about it and the senior agent told me just advice the front desk officer when we do the check-in. Nobody told me or email me in advance that it wasn't available. If I only knew, I cancelled my booking. My kids are disappointed! This hotel is not family friendly, the room so small. The free breakfast is not even a breakfast. The food at the aircraft was better! 2 rooms, suppose to be 4 breakfast but they gave us 2 only. We have to call the frontdesk somemore for it. According to the hotel information the parking is free charge. They have only 2 parking space! My husband parked at the hdb infront and paid per hour! Never again for this hotel. Wasted my money!

In general, I can say that this is a good pick for travellers who want to go to attractions in SG because it is located in the middle of the city. Easy to book grab too from the hotel."

My husband and I had difficulty moving around the room. It was very small. We cannot even open both of our small luggages at the same time. We also booked for a double room but was given twin room. Saying that there\u2019s no available double room when we checked in. \u2b55\ufe0fvery limited TV channels. Nothing interesting on their chosen channels. \u2b55\ufe0f toilet is very small too. No bidet!! \u2b55\ufe0fstaffs were not helpful enough when you need or request something. Good for 1 night stay only, max 2 nights if needed. Recommended for solo travelers only."

Since HGI\u2019s ad on Agoda did not mention any minimum age requirements for check-in, we perceived HGI as OK. Upon arrival, I was denied checking-in due to the misinformation on Agoda (either one of us had to be at least 21 y/o). Waited for three hours there! I called Agoda, regarding this matter but HGI stood firm on its policy even after Agoda intervened. Later on, HGI CANCELLED my reservation without my acknowledgement. Another appalling thing was that the front desk personnel called Nick, told me that I needed a companion who\u2019s 21 y/o & above to check-in with me and even suggested that I ask a random stranger to check-in with me. The horror! HGI Singapore should do better."

He told us that you have to pay your deposit or you will be not get your room access cards. We told him we have not enough cash at that moment and we dont have a credit card. If a debit card, it will take some time to refund back. He told us to draw cash at any atms nearby. So, we did. Then, when we came back with the cash, we saw a very long line of queue at the reception. We approached him and he told us to queue again. And we waited in line for more than half an hour. For goodness sake! You already registered us earlier ago and we have to re-queue.?! So much hassle in the checking in process! Then, we have to wait again for our room."

Location wise, it is perfect to experience the local culture. Surrounded by plenty of delicious food stalls. The staff was always very attentive to your needs.

The only one issue was that I had requested a quiet room; I appreciate it's not always possible to accommodate these requests, but my room was in the Serangoon Tower, right at the end so virtually backed on to the very busy, often noisy main road. Definitely not a quiet room but overall I still enjoyed my stay."

Not in the busy centre of little india, and only 2 mins walk to MRT. 5 mins walk to Mustafa center and so many food options around the hotel. The best thing is, this hotel got a 7-11. So you are saved even you forgot something in the middle of the night. Definitely, this will be my stay in Singapore if I needed to stay somewhere close to little india."

This could be improved. The staff was nice about it but the service level could be better improved on weekends. Note that there will be no housekeeping services during your stay unless you are planning to stay for more than 3 nights."

Room rate is much higher than normal this time as it was the school holidays but still worthwhile as I like the friendly staff, the good location and the big floor areas of the clean and comfortable rooms.

We noticed the odour is everywhere in the buiding. - Power points are not universal sockets so we had to buy an adaptor. - Daily buffet breakfast menu is dull - this too needs an uplift. Hotel is understaffed particularly during staycation period. Do expect longer queue to be serve. - Hotel vibe gave this somber mood to us + Room view was great 'City View' + Lifts were quite fast + Club lounge access is 6pm-8pm and all day refreshments are available + Most staff were friendly but some lack customer interaction experience + Hotel location is central to most tourist spots. We mainly walked to places like Chinatown Street Market, Peoples Park, Maxwell Food Centre, Clarke Quay, Bugis Street/ Bugis Junction, Lau Pa Sat hawker centre, Hajii land and Arab lane."

We were there on CNY eve n the staff looked like all are involved in serving. Negative: 1)We asked abt interconnecting / adjoining room and was told by check-in counter staff we need to.pay for to secure one. First time heard of the need to pay extra for adjoining room. 2) Our dad's room (if remember correctly is 6022), the floor carpet at the edge of the bathroom, has 2 or 3 stapler pins sharp ends. Informed but understandably nt rectified immediately, but shld at least put something ontop of the sharps. 3) The same room internet (the router) was real bad affect the ability to watch TV programmes. 4) The same room the bathroom shower tap not user friendly. Different from the room i was given which on comparison, appeared to hve been changed or uograded."

The first suite we viewed reeks of smoke smell , and there was only 1 double bed when I have 4 persons, and they suggested to put two single beds into the room. I\u2019ve paid for two rooms and two bathrooms , and they were trying to just up sell us one room?! We rejected the suite and went to check out a normal room 2) so we settled for a normal room but was told that we have to wait for the other room which would be ready by 5 or 530pm. But in e end there was still no call by 630- we had to head down to the reception to ask for the status, and we were still shocked to see that the check in queue was still long, unbelievable 3) state of the room was also old, the shower head holder came out of the wall, the second room that we were given- the tv was not working , and there\u2019s an ancient DVD player- we called the front desk but no one picked up. We wanted to ask for bottled water too- but no one picked up the calls- we called in intervals of 10-15mins , and so we went down to the reception once again- and the staff told us that the lines could be engaged. But the fact was we called multiple times, it\u2019s just not right that someone is actually at the reception, but he\u2019s not picking up the phone. Even a two stars hotel will pick up phone calls no matter what , and that we have to head down just to ask for water Overall, it\u2019s really an unpleasure stay and we will never come back again ."

They did not even provide the daily share of water. The lady dressed like a manager in the restaurant was very rude on the busier day of my stay. For an instance when a customer approched her for the tissue she just replied buffet closed. I have never seen anyone replying that way in a reputed hotel. Very unprofessional by all means. I would recommend the hotel if you are looking for a cheap 4 star one and don't care about the service. Because there is no service at all."

Nevertheless, the staffs really work hard to maintain provide good services and overall cleanliness. It is really located near to Chinatown and CBD. The rooms are consider big, spacious, large beds and comes with bathtubs and separate showers. My suggestions to hotel management are to refurbish the hotel's lobby, hall rooms, rooms and amenities with new upgrades as well as vibrant colours. The entertainment systems also need to be upgraded, up to date with current technology."

Could hardly hear the traffic at all. The room itself looked partially refurbished, but otherwise very comfortable and well-sized (for a city hotel). I enjoyed the hot water machine, much better than the standard kettle supplied in hotel rooms. Hotel wifi was stable and fast, but unsecured. This is not big issue unless you are concerned about cybersecurity over an unsecured network (e.g. banking). Each room does come with a secured network (password-protected), but it was down during my stay and took 4 days to set up, hopefully this has been rolled out for all the rooms by now. Hotel staff were helpful and supportive through my stay, the manager understood my concerns and personally ensured my request was resolved. Would definitely consider staying again."

After waiting another 30min our number was called and we were made to go back down to reception and resumed our Q. Since our Q no was on a bigger number, we had to wait for the front to be cleared. We asked a staff why we were shifted up and down and still in a Q. He rumbled and was angrily blaming his chairman for reducing the room rate that causes the overbooking. Over at the check in counter, we saw 3 struggling front desk staff with super long chcek in procedures that also contributed to the not moving Q. When our turn, we were welcomed by a stressed looking gentleman who told us they are left with only single rooms. We offered to wait for housekeepers have not finish cleaning the room so we can get what we booked for"

When i questioned this there appeared to be no reason so i was met with wishy-washy responses like 'we'll tell the management'. But this response was from the Duty Manager. Who was he going to tell? Himself? On checking out i asked for a receipt. The person behind the counter said i should ask Agoda, so I asked why they couldn't supply one and i got less than friendly response followed by the person staring at the desk for the rest of the conversation and mumbling 'uh-huh, uh-huh, yes I AM Listening.' Although they clearly has no interest in listening. All in all guest relations seemed more in line with prisons, than a hotel. It made the last guests half-eaten cake and snacks that i found in my fridge no more than an unhygienic after-thought."

Room-wise, the hot water dispenser is very useful however, placed too high, probably suitable for tall guests, but it would be difficult for shorter people to see into the cup (very dangerous for hot water). Body wash/shampoo wasn\u2019t filled up enough upon check in; room wasn\u2019t prepared thoroughly. Other than that everything\u2019s great great.

It was side by side but not connected. It was so annoying as i have to walk over a pillar just to get to another room. Other than that, all the staffs are great, welcoming and accommodating.

We were promptly met at the entrance by an elderly bell boy who helped unloaded our two pieces of luggage and carried them all the way to the Reception Counter. Kudos to this gentleman for exhibiting this level of sterling service. Unfortunately whatever good impression our elderly gentleman gave me of this hotel was all eroded once I was at Reception. A very wooden looking Shawn processed my check in in the most officious and functional way possible, without any smile or any extra ounce of effort to get any of the freebies my wife asked for as a newly minted Pan Pac member. All requests were faced with the same response - No you can\u2019t. Of course I acknowledge that this young gentleman was most likely not empowered to do more than the paper work but at least he has to be trained how to say no or decline any requests politely, cheerfully and regretfully right? Well, this is not the end. The last straw of this unwelcoming reception happened when our dear Shawn said in an extremely condescending tone \u2018So you know how to use the free wifi right? Your room number followed by your surname!\u2019 Under normal circumstances, I would have said yes and then walked off but because of his tone, I asked him, \u2018So what is my surname?\u2019 And expectedly, he said \u2018Chiew\u2019 in an extremely sheepish manner as obviously my surname is \u2018Hon\u2019 as I am Hon Chiew Weng! I don\u2019t want to break Shawn\u2019s rice bowl or cause him distress but if he wishes to continue doing this job at your hotel, he has to go for a lot of customer service training! Thank goodness I checked into my room and was instantly happy again! The room was clean, spacious and with a fantastic pool view (contrary to what Shawn said about me facing Suntec City because I paid for the lowest room class)!"

One of us got Covid on 20 Feb. We started emailing and messaging the hotel daily since 20 Feb but the first reply we received was on 23 Feb. We appealed to the hotel to change our dates but the hotel was adamant about maintaining their no date change policy. Agoda's support even said, \"As of now your booking is still valid, just in case you change your mind and decide to use it.\" As if it is possible to change our minds and un-have Covid!!! We understand the booking policy of the hotel. But we also know of other five star hotels with similar policies which are more flexible in this covid situation. We managed to give away the booking to someone else late in the night. Even though Agoda's room facilities labeled balcony / terrace, they were given a room without one. Pan Pacific used to be a great place to stay but this incident has shown that the service has dropped significantly, showing neither compassion, flexibility nor an accurate representation of the room's facilities. If Pan Pacific management is reading this, I urge you to rethink your flexibility. It would be terrible to force other people to go to your property when they are unwell and spread the virus even further. Thank you."

Thus my review is based on Parkroyal Marina Bay. Really grand hotel when looking from the outside. But room is a little dated and not exactly clean. The floor has marks from previous occupants and the toilet walls are black with fungus. Customer service is terrible. Upon checking in, no one informed us that the hairdryer in the toilet cannot be used. We only learnt that it was not supposed to be used after my mother turned it on and it caused a spark that sizzled and lit up the room and caused blackout. Their room cleaning staff told us it cannot be used that\u2019s why they placed another one in the clothes cabinet for us to use instead. To that I ask, how would we know, if your customer service didn\u2019t tell us or even leave a note in the room to inform us? Their breakfast is buffet style and we had a young girl serving us at the bread counter. She served another customer bread and accidentally dropped one piece on the counter. The customer picked it up using his bare hands and placed it back on the breadplate and asked for a new piece. After giving him a new piece, she just proceeded to rearrange the dropped bread nicely like it never was dropped and ready to be served to the next customer. Really appalling from a hotel. Will not recommend to anyone."

We were not aware that housekeeping will only be arrange via phone/in-house app and not for every room. So when we were leaving our room, we tried to get the attention of a housekeeping staff who happened to be cleaning up the room next to ours. But the staff did not sound very happy about it and told us \"not me, not me.\" which surprised us. Maybe this form of communication can be improved with further training.

They became fast friends, holding hands and walking alongside me. Instantly, I felt a wave of relief! This is the first time I experience help outside and I greatly appreciate it! While I did my check-in, I overheard Sam negotiating with my little one that if he can get in the pram, he will get him some chocolates while Jimmy kept watch. Everything went smoothly, I even had a nice room upgrade for my toddler\u2019s birthday! This is the most impressive service I have received from any hotel so far! Thank u Pan Pacific for going the extra mile to make my day less stressful. Having a meltdown before the day started was no joke and I\u2019m thankful for Jimmy and Sam. They deserve a recognition award for what they have done! I will always remember these 2 names in association with Pan Pacific and the great service standard! Highly recommended hotel to stay in!"

The room is really wonderful and very clean eventhough we didn\u2019t get a nice view but it was alright. All the basic amenities in the room was provided. They even arranged for a slice of cake to be delivered since we are celebrating our anniversary."

Also. definitely not recommended for anyone who finds water as essential (hotel charge for $3 per bottle beyond what is provided in the room). Had to go to the lobby to collect bucket of ice ourselves and go all the way up to 29th floor with crowd of people waiting for the lift (yeah its 5 star service don\u2019t be surprised). Spoke to the duty manager and even he agreed this is the first hotel he had experienced with such regulations. Fridge was locked for no reason (despite no mini bar snacks at all when we checked in) and we had to make several phone calls before we could eventually retrieve our personal food items from the fridge at check out. Hotel Technician had to dismantle the whole fridge door to figure out whats wrong with it. Finally, we stormed off with a really bad experience. With the amount of money, suggest travelers to go elsewhere. Really not recommended at all. The only good thing is, location is near shopping malls, thats it."

I was worried about the check in process since there was a surge in staycation due to the Singapore vouchers. However, my worries are all nothing. I checked in early and got an upgrade to panaroma room as it was my boy birthday. Check in was fast and the front counters has many staffs to direct us for fast check in. Room was clean and sound proof was good. I wasn't too worried if my boy cry in the night. Morning breakfast never fails to impress us.. We didn't get to swim as it was very rainy. The only inconvenience is when you have a stroller and it is raining. The exits to the mall on 2nd floor were all closed and only level 1 exit to marina square mall is open. But there is only escalator available. Another option is via the main entrance but if it is a rainy day, then it will be very inconvenience. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will return again..."
