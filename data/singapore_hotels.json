Despite calling the front desk and letting them know about this issue, the noises still persisted the next morning. I am very disappointed with this experience. I'm not talking about any noise, it's those noises where staff were laughing and shouting at the top of their lungs. I hope you can tell your staff to be more considerate for the guests in the future. All in all, I would still come back to stay at this hotel."

I thot only one side was sinking... the whole bed was sinking when i sat around to find a comfortable position. Its was a horrible night sleep. The pillow was alrite. My biggest issue is the bed. A hotel is for u to rest. If u are not fussy about a sinking bed and is ok waking up with a backache, by all means this hotel is for u, otherwise, look elsewhere."

The view was great from the 27th floor, and although the room is not as big as what you\u2019d get from other hotels, Yotel made sure that it was a good use of space, and every part of the room was well thought out. The facilities/amenities provided were good (including the free welcome Cocktail), and the only gripe I had was the fact that the bath and the room itself is only separated by a glass panel, and water did leak out to the room itself, it\u2019d have been nice if there was a small slope or step from the shower to the room so that it doesn\u2019t happen though. But otherwise, a fantastic place to stay in, and Orchard Road is just a stone\u2019s throw away. Great location. Will definitely come again!"

The room looks like in a futuristic set up. They call it a cabin. It's kinda tight for a queen sized bed. For travelers who have a back problem like me... The bed is quite soft for support. I guess it's built that way so that it can be bent. There is also no proper table which made it hard for me to do some desk top work. I used the foldable thing built below the tv which also works but not for longer hours. So if u plan to stay there and so some work, it's not a good place. I love the view from the toilet tho!

Could hardly hear the traffic at all. The room itself looked partially refurbished, but otherwise very comfortable and well-sized (for a city hotel). I enjoyed the hot water machine, much better than the standard kettle supplied in hotel rooms. Hotel wifi was stable and fast, but unsecured. This is not big issue unless you are concerned about cybersecurity over an unsecured network (e.g. banking). Each room does come with a secured network (password-protected), but it was down during my stay and took 4 days to set up, hopefully this has been rolled out for all the rooms by now. Hotel staff were helpful and supportive through my stay, the manager understood my concerns and personally ensured my request was resolved. Would definitely consider staying again."

After waiting another 30min our number was called and we were made to go back down to reception and resumed our Q. Since our Q no was on a bigger number, we had to wait for the front to be cleared. We asked a staff why we were shifted up and down and still in a Q. He rumbled and was angrily blaming his chairman for reducing the room rate that causes the overbooking. Over at the check in counter, we saw 3 struggling front desk staff with super long chcek in procedures that also contributed to the not moving Q. When our turn, we were welcomed by a stressed looking gentleman who told us they are left with only single rooms. We offered to wait for housekeepers have not finish cleaning the room so we can get what we booked for"

When i questioned this there appeared to be no reason so i was met with wishy-washy responses like 'we'll tell the management'. But this response was from the Duty Manager. Who was he going to tell? Himself? On checking out i asked for a receipt. The person behind the counter said i should ask Agoda, so I asked why they couldn't supply one and i got less than friendly response followed by the person staring at the desk for the rest of the conversation and mumbling 'uh-huh, uh-huh, yes I AM Listening.' Although they clearly has no interest in listening. All in all guest relations seemed more in line with prisons, than a hotel. It made the last guests half-eaten cake and snacks that i found in my fridge no more than an unhygienic after-thought."

Room-wise, the hot water dispenser is very useful however, placed too high, probably suitable for tall guests, but it would be difficult for shorter people to see into the cup (very dangerous for hot water). Body wash/shampoo wasn\u2019t filled up enough upon check in; room wasn\u2019t prepared thoroughly. Other than that everything\u2019s great great.

I thought sound proofing in hotels were good but it is proven wrong. As it stopped, I did not call for assistance. 4) Too many people at the lobby waiting to check-in or checking-in. I think the check-in system is great. We can book for a slot and get a number. I got an upgrade and got a room with a great view. It was great! The staff who helped me with the check-in was great too."

Not sure if it is due to current pandemic, it is such a pain that each time to take the lift to go up the room u need to announce your room number and all the occupants names for the \"gatekeeper\" to register into his laptop and likewise when you exit the lift...

The Infinity Pool was amazing, and breathtaking. The only issue we encountered during our stay is the rude staff (and provided us wrong information about the booking system for the Infinity Pool) that was monitoring the entrance to the Infinity Pool on our first day. But the hotel staff made it up with an extended check out timing. Shout out to Devi, the staff that help us with the check-in. Amazing service from her. 10/10 would recommend it here."

While the view from the room was spectacular (granted that you book rooms at the higher level), there is room for improvement for the staff service. The staff service was rather inconsistent, with a small handful of hotel staff providing excellent service and majority of the hotel staff providing mediocre service. The only memorable service received was when the receptionist managed to squeeze us in for a slot for the infinity pool. We had a not so good experience when we were given inconsistent message regarding utensils request. At first they told us it was chargeable if we request for more than a dozen of utensils. When we clarified with the receptionist during our check-out, she said that requesting for utensils is not chargeable at all, regardless of number of utensils requested. Quite inconsistent in the message given... Most of the staff there were also quite unenthusiastic, not the kind of service level I was expecting from MBS. Perhaps it is because of the high volume of Singaporeans doing staycation there?"

But it was our honeymoon night and even though we could not travel for our honeymoon, we are really glad we chose to stay at MBS. We had such an amazing time at MBS. From the moment we stepped out of the car, until the moment that we checked out - the service was extremely top notch from the staff at MBS. Shoutout to Firdaus from the Sky Park and his team, as well as Pauline from the receptions team, for the highly commendable service. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone."

For the pool - you must book a 1 hour slot during the day. It was a busy weekend so there were no more slots available in the booking website. They kindly found us a slot at 11pm - just nice for a midnight swim. It was actually a better option, nice view of the night lights. The rooms weren't anything special, but the view and the service is stellar!"

There\u2019s a lot of restaurants to choose from and a food court too. MRT is just right there too. The infinity pool is the cherry on the top however, due to covid-19, it\u2019s access is limited to an hour and you have to book it in advance. You are force to vacate after the given slot as they clean the facilities (sunbeds, tables, etc) and prepare it for the next slot. It feels restricting but gives you security as well that everything has been cleaned and safe. In room food is quite pricey but delish!"

But if you don't travel and only stay locally, MBS is slightly above average. Location, convenient enough since it's right next to the bayfront mrt and walking distance to the attractions such as gardens by the bay,shopping malls etc. Facilities were okay, shower head was a little rusty but it was plastic, not sure what's happening there. The table beside the bed was dusty AF, just happened to drop my child's milk bottle behind it and dust was literally flying everywhere. Balcony facing the gardens by the bay was nice but floor was dirty and took the grand out of the view a little. Skypark was the worse. View was mediocre at best. Maps that were printed in multiple languages at the viewing areas were peeling off, signs were faded due to rain or sun. Apparently maintenance took a day off here. Value for money? I paid around 600 for one night, quite affordable for a hotel of this calibre but I definitely would not consider it value for money. If it was heavily discounted, I might recommend MBS, other than that, you're better off elsewhere. Unless you're filthy rich and have no concept of money. Staff fortunately was the saving grace for this entire endeavour. Pleasant, polite and helpful."

Opened up so many rooms for stay yet only allow a max of 200 ppl at the pool. As a result you either you either have to go wake up Super early to try your luck with their lousy Q system or wait until late before you can even know if you can come up to swim. No complimentary parking for hotel guests. Ridiculous check out timing at 1100hrs. Staffs were not accommodating in any way. Seems like they only pay attention to their VIPs and disregard everyone else. All in all, MBS is nice to look at but not the best to stay in if you\u2019re in Singapore. Never coming back and wasting my money."

Knowing we were celebrating our first anniversary, MBS was so sweet to prepare us a cake. We were very surprised and felt so thankful. We would also like to express our heartfelt thanks to the front desk staff, Mary Jane, for assisting us in our check-in. Her attitude was really good. She made an effort to explain the terms and conditions by MBS and also the different kinds of facilities that MBS provides. Thank you Mary Jane, thank you MBS."

We chose Gaylang for the budget and despite its being known for the dark area, many fellows who have stayed here said there was nothing bad about it at all. The room was pretty small, but full of liveliness. I REALLY LOVE THE COLORS ON THE WALL AND THE GRAPHICS AROUND THE BED. It is such a stylish hotel. Bathroom was very small, but we didn't need it that big anyway. So we choose Fragrance Ruby for the new and nice look of the hotel, and also the price. At first we got two room on the same floor, but one of them was full with cigarette smell so we asked the hotel for help. They changed the room for us but it was on a different floor, so we had to split. Bad thing is that the elevator takes you only to the floor on which your room is. But that was not a big deal. We actually arrived before check-in time, and could drop our luggage at the hotel before going back there again after lunch. Overall was satisfying."

If you want a place where you can just doze for the night, take a shower and change, you can book in this hotel."

Inside the room, there was hair dryer, shampoo, soap liquid, 2 drink water, electric kettle, towels, tv. if we hava a chance for backing to Singapore, we will stay here."

LATIFAH & DANIEL just looked at us as if I ruined their chatting. No greetings at all and LATIFAH even told me I have to wait because she's already 'running her system' which I found so senseless. They keep on murmuring to each other not caring if we're in front of them. Finally after few minutes, gave us our room key. Without saying anything. O was really pissed. Our room is 'fine', I booked for superior queen bed, they gave us 2 single beds. Ask them they said my 'request is subject to availability'. Like what?! I paid for it! They don't know how to check guests requests/bookings? The next day, they 'upgrade' us. But it became the 'WORST STAY EVER' We can't sleep at all because the room smells paint! We can breath ,we decided to book in another hotel. Its the worst hotel I've ever been! Feel bad for Ibis buying this hotel/management"

My only comment is that when you get back to your room after having it cleaned, it sometimes leaves a bad smell from the bathroom.

The management are very coercive for everyone to deposit a refundable 500 SGD for cleaning purposes however they are not intent on returning it and will keep punching away one excuse after another. I checked-out on the 16th January when I was assured that the deposit should happen quickly although the T&C say 7-14 working days. I have followed up consistently thereafter with the same technical assurances. fast forward to 3rd February now, Im being asked to show proof of having payed the deposit in the 1st place ! The hotel management have really showed no commitment to refund my money back which suggests outright fraud behaviour. Please look elsewhere."

The location is also quite centralised & most importantly it is one of the most value for money hotels that provides complimentary parking to in house guests. For this staycation, the check in process took too long. About 15 - 30 mins for one check in. The hotel management should look at ways to refine the check in process. However, the staff were very service oriented. Some of the staff did their best to shorten the queue by asking guests waiting in the queue what kind of help they needed & responded accordingly. I was one of those who was offered by a staff (Hui Jia) to help me check in at the back end office. Indeed the service was amazing. Thank you very much Hui Jia. The lady housekeeping staff serving 13th floor was also very good. I requested for my room to be cleaned up while I went for a quick brunch and indeed when I was back in less than an hour, my room was perfectly cleaned up. Thank you very much to the housekeeping staff. I would love to return to Ramada for future staycations if the price is still competitive."

Waited in the lobby for an hour in a cordoned off \u201cVTL\u201d area but not too far away from other people. Somehow seems like they forgotten about me and I had to check with them before they bring me into my room. Room is not bad, have spaces for my luggage and clean. However, they are not soundproof at all, constantly hearing footsteps and even people\u2019s phone notifications. Mattress and pillows are nice. Decent stay, feels 4 stars but overpriced for the price I paid $200 (probably high season)."

Check out time was only extended for 30mins despite late check in timing. Recommend if possible to extend for longer check out time if the check in time was delayed. 2. Waiting time for elevator (3 star) Due to the SHN for one of the elevator and the other elevator only accessible for B1 carpark to lvl 3, only 2 elevators left for hotel guests and ballroom guests, hence the waiting time for the elevator is quite long at times. 3. Hotel/ Staff Service (4 stars) Requested for ice and was told that we need to head down with the bucket from our room to the BAR at level 1. This created quite a hassle for guests. Not too sure if it\u2019s due to covid or the hotel does not provide the service to the room. Fast service (5-10mins) for the replacement of in room kettle as it did not work. During check out, as there was additional billing to be made, we could not do the express check out and had to queue. However, staff was able to assist us to process the check out with billing without the need to queue. As we need to head for lunch and get other stuffs around the area, they also allowed us to keep our luggages with them although we have checked out. Appreciated. 4. Accessibility (4 stars) The hotel is a little far off from nearest MRT, Novena. About a 15mins walking distance away. However, there is a mall and other eateries around the area. 5. Pool (5 stars) The pool is pretty for photos and spacious for guests to swim and hang out at their own corners."

If hotel know that no room is available for early check, please inform guest via email when the early check in request was put up. And, when people called to check for early check in. The staff should straight away say that no room is available for early check in. At 2pm, I was still waiting my room. I asked the front desk staff, she told me to wait and the room is still under cleaning. I asked again how long it takes to finish the cleaning, the staff told me that she can't promise! So, I wait for my room from 12pm to 2pm, now still need to wait but dun know how long to wait some more? The staff attitude is bad and unprofessional. When check out, there was no express check out lane. For those stay cation local guest have to queue together with oversea traveller at the same check out lane. Personally, I feel this is a risk during covid. I spent 30mins to queue but less than 5mins to complete my check out. I will never come back to this hotel anymore."

I arrived together with a VTL guest around 2300hrs, got out of my car, and proceeded to SafeEntry point and then to reception table. At the reception counter when I surrendered our ID and passport, I was immediately asked if we are \"registering our names\". I gave the confused look and asked what registering??? I was there to check-in into the hotel. The staff was also confused and after I said the guest just arrived vis the VTL Lane, she immediately understood and proceeded to guide us in the check-in. Another staff immediately retorted that we should have followed the signage and check-in using another door. What another door???? And so I realised there was this signage outside that apparently has an arrow sign to direct VTL guests to another door!!!! And we went through the wrong door. And so it is our fault. It is our fault for walking through the wrong glass door when there was actually no one to guide us, notwithstanding there was a signage in the frontage. And it was our fault for not reading all the signages of the hotel before we stepped in? Great service! Bad experience! And so my VTL guest was guided to another table some 10m away, and check-in went smoothly after that. Throughout the 7-days stay, my VTL guest and I had experienced multiple times where the room card will no longer work and we had to go down again to have it re-verified. Very irritating. On the day of my check-out, same thing happened again. This time I decided to verify how the staff would react if I were to tell her my card failed on me the 4th time. And so I again proceeded down the lift, and went to reception. I immediately told the staff (Joanne, indian lady) that they card failed the 4th time on me. She proceeded to re-code the card and ignored my feedback. I asked again when she returned me the card why did the card fail again? She replied that I have to come re-code the c"

They have corner-off an area for continuous swimming. Gym was clean and well equipped. Gym and pool open from 7am to 10pm. Staff was professional and friendly.

Relatively safe even for families with young children since the neighborhood is surrounded by apartment buildings (NOT brothels, I read that this is located in the red light district). As for the rooms, my only suggestion is to label the lights and water heater switch. They clean and change the sheets & towels daily, and provide us with bottled water, teas and coffee (also daily).

When we check with hotel staff on the road side parking fees payment method, the answer I got was \u201cI am not sure.\u201d The staff never take any initiative to check for us as we are not Singaporean, she just continue on her work.

Our room was at the corner and we can hear clearly whenever the upper floors water flush through the piping , it was so annoying and wake us up early in the morning, the sound was so loud as if it was like raining on top of your roof! The last day stay in the room was totally unbearable, should have ask them to change the room for us earlier Overall this hotel is clean, good , food convenient and worth for money to stay in singapore if u have children and u are looking for a room with a private bathroom.

That said, this is quite far from most of the tourist spots but public transportation in Singapore is very efficient so it\u2019s not much of a hassle, it just takes a bit of your time. We never tried taking the train as the nearest station is quite far, but there are a lot of bus stops nearby. Room is quite spacious for its price - SG standards. Bed was big and comfortable. All the facilities were working properly - AC, hot shower, TV, lights, etc. Staff were friendly and helpful. There\u2019s also computers at the lobby if you need to use one. Wi-Fi is terrible though, I suggest you buy a sim. The only thing I would say that I didn\u2019t like is that the door to the bathroom is made of glass, which is not good if you\u2019re staying with friends like we did. It was frosted but you could still see through it. Overall, it was a really good stay. Would recommend."

Standard rooms, simple but efficient and clean, although ours smelled of smoke because guests are disrespectful of the rules.

At least there has no any place to hang our clothes. 5)I booked two number of rooms and one room has separate bath shampoo and shower gel.But for my other room i had only shower gel.When i asked about it from the reception,they said shower gel and the hair shampoo both are the same.So i have to go outside and spend some extra money for purchase those shampoo items for my use. 6) There is no one to help us carrying our languages.

They focus only on telling us extra payment requirement if we got covid. Nxt day morning, me and my gf ordered their American breakfast set (without any special order) at their breakfast cafe. They forgot our order and we waited more than 20min till we notice the table beside us receive their order (they ordered the same item as us) even though we are there much earlier. When food is served, we notice that we are missing several food item from the breakfast set (grilled tomato, ham, bacon etc) and the egg choice is wrong as well. What puzzled us is how did they serve us the food with 3 item missing and did not realize it since it is part of standard menu. Told the staff and he changed it for us, only to bring out wrong item again. All in all, our food item is wrong served 3 time. Their poached egg is also cold like it been left in the aircon for quite some time as well as overcooked (like hard boiled egg). Their tea and juice is also very diluted. Only good thing we can think of is their staff brought us the beer can opener at night time when we called their front desk and request for it."

However, we have to keep an eye on our 7 months baby when we put him on bed as the bed was quite high compare to standard. We requested a baby cot the next day and thanks to the staff for arranging it as previously was told the room was quite crowed if they were to put a baby cot in. Thanks to the housekeeping staff as well to change the bed sheet when requested due to certain reason. It was a pleasant n great stay for us there. Besides, it was within walking distance to bugis+, bugis Street and bugis Junction mall in 10 minutes. Strategic location with a lot bus stop nearby."

Marina Bay precinct can be accessed with a 20 minute walk. That's kind of where the good part ends. This is an obviously older and now quite tired hotel. The facilities were adequate, but the room was tired but adequate. Dining in the restaurant was extremely disappointing for one evening meal we had there (seafood buffet), and the breakfast was adequate, but nothing more. I would suggest that this hotel is a relatively cheap option if you don't intend to spend any time in the hotel other than sleeping, and that you dine elsewhere."

Firstly there were stairs right when you reach the entrance and no one was there to assist you life your luggage up. I was only offered assistances when I reach the front desk which was obviously too late. Recep was not friendly at all. She did not even give a smile. Another guest interrupted but she clearly did not speak English and she seemed like like lost her bag. But instead of offering help, Recep have her a look of disgust. Like she couldn\u2019t be bothered. She just replied with a \u201chuh? What? no no no. I don\u2019t know.\u201d And went on with doing her staff. She then handed me over to another Recep. A younger male who seemed new or maybe just reserved. Seemed nervous. She kept on telling him what to do and what room to give me. Spoke in Chinese infront of me which to me was offensive. If you need to speak in private pull him aside instead of just telling him across the front desk in another language. Someone else could have assumed that they were talking about them. So it is definitely not nice at all. Room was old and dated. Bedsheet Had some stains on it. I called for ice. Remember I\u2019m paying $400 for one night. I was then told that a bucket of ice would cost $5. I\u2019ve never been charged for ice so to me this was absurd given the price I was paying and this was not a budget hotel. Pushed one of the beds to the corner as I needed more space and lo and behold, dust and rubbish were found. Clearly they have not swept or vacuumed under the bed for years. Lift was also old and slow. There were different buttons for different lifts. So that was confusing too. All in all, totally not worth the price. Not a very pleasant experience too. Very much disappointed and a total waste of $400."

I handed my credit card to the lady staff when a deposit was required. She processed the transaction but however, a male staff completed the transaction & returned my card instead. I thought it was strange that she didn't return my card herself. I think it is important that the same person who handled a customer's card should be the one to return back to the customer as this would prevent an error in returning to a wrong customer. Finally, did she wish me a pleasant stay in the hotel? I didn't expect any but it would have made my day if she did."

While booking it was never mentioned that breakfast is pre-packed. The breakfast was non edible and mostly stone cold when delivered at our door. So we ended giving the majority of our breakfast packs away or throwing them in the rubbish bin. It was really a waste of money. So do not pay for their breakfast! We tried it this time because the website says that cafeteria is now available and we did not realize that breakfast is pre-packed! It was really disappointing! There is also very limited viewing channel thats why this time around we brought our apple device to be able to watch decent films :) Other than the horrible pre packed breakfast and limited viewing option, we actually enjoyed the location, the staff and the hotel itself. That\u2019s why we came back and stayed even longer this time."

Stay was not bad, quite clean as things are new.. but I won\u2019t stay there again as my experience was not so positive as I waited more than 1 hour for check in that day due to school holiday period"

Room in real life looks very different from what was pictured. Was a little disappointed with the outcome. Asked for Late Check out and was told to check out anytime before 1pm. Received a call from front desk at 12.15pm asking me to check out immediately. Very disappointed by the rude service by the Front Desk. When checking out, I still have to wait 5 to 10 mins to check out. Overall, it was a disappointing experience and will never consider coming back.."

I had paid for my stay, yes I understand that the usual procedure needs to be done, but you are severely under staffed. Well. i just left, that's it. Definitely won't be returning. So guys if you are reading this review, do think twice unless they can offer you cancellation if you didn't manage to check in. Well just too bad i had to forfeit my stay."

I was doing my night shift earlier before checking in. My wife offered to pay for another extension since she knew I was knocked out too tired but next moment she knew they already open the room which I felt theres no privacy.

While I expected it to be compact, I didn\u2019t not expect having the bed facing the toilet. Yep, you sit on the bed, and you see the toilet as the bathroom door is a glass one. It makes me really uncomfortable. Being in a very compact room without window and see the toilet from literally anywhere, I don\u2019t know if I wanna stay there again. I think you can stay in a better-layout room with the same price if you can tolerate a bit more distance from the city centre. Honestly Singapore is very small, and it is so easy to commute to anywhere."

All space within the room is put to use. Refrigerator is hidden under the bed, built in drawers open to reveal a small safety deposit box, or space for clothes, etc. TV on the wall opposite the bed. Everything was kept very clean. The room key card activated the electricity for the rooms lights and air conditioning. Staff were very friendly when I asked any questions. BUT there was lack of any communication or brochures listing any of the available amenities. EG: I was never told there were self serve laundry facilities on the premises. Nor that there is a nice outdoor balcony / lounge area (5th or 6th floor if I remember) overlooking the park across the street. Reception does have water available, maps of the local area."

Despite calling the front desk and letting them know about this issue, the noises still persisted the next morning. I am very disappointed with this experience. I'm not talking about any noise, it's those noises where staff were laughing and shouting at the top of their lungs. I hope you can tell your staff to be more considerate for the guests in the future. All in all, I would still come back to stay at this hotel."

I thot only one side was sinking... the whole bed was sinking when i sat around to find a comfortable position. Its was a horrible night sleep. The pillow was alrite. My biggest issue is the bed. A hotel is for u to rest. If u are not fussy about a sinking bed and is ok waking up with a backache, by all means this hotel is for u, otherwise, look elsewhere."

The view was great from the 27th floor, and although the room is not as big as what you\u2019d get from other hotels, Yotel made sure that it was a good use of space, and every part of the room was well thought out. The facilities/amenities provided were good (including the free welcome Cocktail), and the only gripe I had was the fact that the bath and the room itself is only separated by a glass panel, and water did leak out to the room itself, it\u2019d have been nice if there was a small slope or step from the shower to the room so that it doesn\u2019t happen though. But otherwise, a fantastic place to stay in, and Orchard Road is just a stone\u2019s throw away. Great location. Will definitely come again!"

The room looks like in a futuristic set up. They call it a cabin. It's kinda tight for a queen sized bed. For travelers who have a back problem like me... The bed is quite soft for support. I guess it's built that way so that it can be bent. There is also no proper table which made it hard for me to do some desk top work. I used the foldable thing built below the tv which also works but not for longer hours. So if u plan to stay there and so some work, it's not a good place. I love the view from the toilet tho! Dint have the chance to experience Yoshi and Yolanda but I guess you guys should check it out! They're cute robots! \ud83d\ude0d"

I requested to change room but refused. I basically stay with this condition for 7 nights! Also, the shower's hot water run out after a short while and becoming cold water.

I request to change the room but was told that the hotel is full and the room I booked is cheap because it is booked online. Later, another guy came and I was able to connect to the internet and the tv. After dinner, I can into the room and turned on the tv , only to find out that it has restored to its \u2018room setting\u2019 and the wifi is not working.

I asked to change rooms and was able to choose from shown two other rooms on the same floor, both with ants around and insects in the jug, but slightly less dusty and worn, with cleaner beds and no smokey smell. There were no water bottles provided as mentioned in other reviews, nor was there an option of breakfast. The terrace mentioned in several reviews was not accessible during my stay.

There is also a fridge in the room as well as a kettle and tea and coffee. Two bottles of water are provided each day. The air conditioning is efficient. The bonus for us was the complimentary breakfast on the rooftop. The lift is really slow but because it only has 4 floors so it won't be a big problem. Friendly and helpful staff."

The most important part is, the location! It's really strategic! It's near 2 mrt stations; Jalan Besar and Rochor. It's easy to find halal food, and cheap food nearby. About 400m to Bugis Street, and about 600m to Mustafa Center. I definitely recommend it to everyone, and will choose Mayo Inn for my next trip. The only thing that need to be upgraded are the lift. But it's okay as it is."

Also, everything in Singapore is expensive compared to other Asian countries so it's expected. Cleanliness and room amenities are great. Location is very strategic, near MRT and bus stations, stores and malls. Also, the complimentary breakfast (not included in room rate) was great and they gave us free bottled water for 2 days. Lastly, they allowed us for an early check-in since it's so hot outside. The downside is very slow internet connection. Despite the high room rate & slow internet connection, it's still highly recommended. Good Job Mayo Inn! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d"

There are plenty of places to eat nearby as well as shops to buy drinks and snacks. It is a quick walk to Bugis street, Arab street and little India. The room I a reasonable size with good storage. The bed is clean and comfortable. The bathroom has a good shower with plentiful hot water. Shower gel and shampoo are provided. There is also a fridge in the room as well as a kettle and tea and coffee. Two bottles of water are provided each day. The air conditioning is efficient. The bonus for us was the complimentary breakfast on the rooftop. There were three options and we loved the steamed buns and egg option washed down with tea and coffee. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We will be back. Thankyou for a great stay."

Let's go through the good points first. 1) Room was a bit more spacious than I expected, with the toilet quite generous. More importantly, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. 2) Even though there wasn't a refrigerator, staff was kind enough to offer a solution which was to place it in a common refrigerator and retrieve it later. Now, the not so good points. 1) The reception is always busy. 9 times out of 10, nobody picks up my call. And I wasn't calling at the peak period (i.e. check in check out timing) either. 2) I understand that parking is not included, and that was made clear when I asked the staff. Staff mentioned that there is a max charge of $15. Imagine my shock when I was charged almost double of that. I'm not sure if a coupon was needed to get that flat rate or not, but I wasn't offered and it was implied to me that per entry, that was the maximum I'll be charged and that it'll be automatic. It's not a large amount but it sure left a sour taste in my mouth. Overall, it's not too bad, a little pricey but maybe don't come when they're busy."

We arrived on a peaked Saturday with lots of occupants in the line for check in, time took about 20mins with 3 counter staff, considered pretty fast. Staffs were very polite and efficient, everything was smooth and made easy. The promo comes with a room upgrade so we default had an King\u2019s room which is adequately sufficient for couples, not a big room but it\u2019s modernly furnished. In the center of Bugis, there\u2019s plenty of food and location to roam about. Then comes the morning breakfast burgers and fries, it was delicious. Check out time was also shifted to 2pm as part of the package, that was hard to miss for any staycation. Overall an very worthy bang for buck promotion, I would at least minimum recommend an King size room thou if you can\u2019t stand small rooms. Another drawback would be the lift which is only one that serves all occupants."

Ordered food was hot but average. No windows in most rooms helps with daytime sleeping. It\u2019s expensive but better than sleeping on the floor or crowded lounges. They have the monopoly on all of the transit passengers that can\u2019t leave the airport, so book in advance. We recommend this location for security, comfort and privacy, but not cost. At least Changi has this option available, most airports don\u2019t!"

Nobody wanted to talk with him, nobody wanted to try to solve this problem. About one and half hour we called from Cambodia to Singapore to try to find somebody who is responsible in this situation. The hotel staff on the phone sent us from one person to another, but no one could help for an hour and a half. At the end, the problem was solved but it costs us too much headache.

I think it\u2019s a bit expensive , because it costs ~$1800 Hong Kong Dollars!! For a room for 12 hours. (Another choice is a bit cheaper but only 6 hours) We stayed there after the flight from Hong Kong to Singapore, and the next flight to Sydney would be at 10am the day after. We would be in the waiting area, unless people come and pick us up by buggy car to the hotel on the first day, or from the hotel to the boarding gate on the second day by buggy car again. We had a good view to the planes parking outside from the room. The room was quite tidy, the bed was okay but my husband said it\u2019s a bit too soft. We received two meals, there were 4 choices, same choices for dinner and breakfast. It\u2019s tasty but the size was small. Therefore we need to order something more from the in room dining manual. But the food from in room dining eg fries and nuggets were excellent though. The room was generally quite comfortable. If we can transit in Singapore next time when it\u2019s non-Covid, we expect that we can have more fun staying in the Changi airport as there are lots of facilities and foodcourt. However now most of them are closed."

The info is there but it is very hidden and the checkin staff said that many people are surprised when checking in that there is a time limit, so it was not only my problem. The price is very stiff for 12 hours limitation. The upgrade offered for more hours was 300 + Singapore Dollars Wifi in the Lobby was perfect, but on the room it did connect to the Internet, but data transfer rate was zero. A call at the reception, I was referred to the Airport Wifi. Just went to bed but left a bad feeling spending so much money and then even not having connectivity. I figured out that they have nice sofas in the transit area which I used in the remaining 12 hours. So if you just need a nap, and not the bathroom, no need for the hotel."

At first I was told nothing could be done, but another staff member did manage to adjust the temperature. 3. The lighting was either too dim or too bright 4. The shower controls were unusual and there was no explanation. I needed to experiment for quite a while, and thought at first that the hot water was disconnected or not functioning. 5. There were signs of wear in the shower floor, which could give the impression of neglect. The impression of cleanliness is also compromised."

I did sleep a few hours, because I was exhausted. But there's no clock in the room. So make sure your c phone is automatically adjusted to the singapore time zone. Not even a box of tissues in the room.. Very basic.. and be careful as I had NO IDEA the c room I booked had a, shared toilet and shower. Ridiculous price for that. Don't even bother with the breakfast... Half of the options are but available anyway. Lol. How sad. 8 options only.. 3 not available.. If my airline's lounge was, open I would happily have paid them instead but as, a, last resort.. Its, a bed.. Dark.. (claustrophobic beware) & I got sleep. Yay."

I enjoyed the hot water machine, much better than the standard kettle supplied in hotel rooms. Hotel wifi was stable and fast, but unsecured. This is not big issue unless you are concerned about cybersecurity over an unsecured network (e.g. banking). Each room does come with a secured network (password-protected), but it was down during my stay and took 4 days to set up, hopefully this has been rolled out for all the rooms by now. Hotel staff were helpful and supportive through my stay, the manager understood my concerns and personally ensured my request was resolved. Would definitely consider staying again."

After a 45mins Q, someone started distributing Q number and moving us to 2nd level to sit and wait. After waiting another 30min our number was called and we were made to go back down to reception and resumed our Q. Since our Q no was on a bigger number, we had to wait for the front to be cleared. We asked a staff why we were shifted up and down and still in a Q. He rumbled and was angrily blaming his chairman for reducing the room rate that causes the overbooking. Over at the check in counter, we saw 3 struggling front desk staff with super long chcek in procedures that also contributed to the not moving Q. When our turn, we were welcomed by a stressed looking gentleman who told us they are left with only single rooms. We offered to wait for housekeepers have not finish cleaning the room so we can get what we booked for"

Himself? On checking out i asked for a receipt. The person behind the counter said i should ask Agoda, so I asked why they couldn't supply one and i got less than friendly response followed by the person staring at the desk for the rest of the conversation and mumbling 'uh-huh, uh-huh, yes I AM Listening.' Although they clearly has no interest in listening. All in all guest relations seemed more in line with prisons, than a hotel.

Hotel itself is just okay average; during my check in there were lack of front desk agents and they were too preoccupied with themselves + when asked for room service at early morning, staff were saying that we need to wait until the housekeeping clock in which is very unprofessional (not to mention the tone of annoyance on the phone). Room-wise, the hot water dispenser is very useful however, placed too high, probably suitable for tall guests, but it would be difficult for shorter people to see into the cup (very dangerous for hot water). Body wash/shampoo wasn\u2019t filled up enough upon check in; room wasn\u2019t prepared thoroughly. Other than that everything\u2019s great great. It\u2019s a good location and price and hotel with enough facilities, if the service improves I believe guests will feel more welcomed&comfortable!"

Dining staff disinterested. I needed my earplugs for a good nights rest as the traffic noise disturbed me but I am a very light sleeper.

We waited another 20 mins for them to clean up the room as there was no other available room at that point of time. The receptionist did not offer to cover back the 20 mins for us by offering later check out at 12.20pm. But, it's ok. They will need to collect SGD50 for deposit. No sound proofing, very noisy, can hear other guests talking at corridor. Not recommend for light sleepers. Offer basic facilities in room. Toilet and bathroom is separated and basin is outside the toilet and bathroom."

Great location in Chinatown, near hawker centres, restos & all the great shops around. We've stayed here about 3 times over the year and has been a consistently good place to stay. Solid choice but next time will book a room with a window."

Room is small but has good organization, clean and worth the price for the location. They offer attraction tickets with a good deal too. Staff are phenomenal, everyone are super friendly and helpful. They set up our room with a sweet complimentary for our special occasion which was so thoughtful and I appreciate that so much. The only con is the noise resistance, we still can hear people clearly in the hallway and our next door neighbor, but it's not that bad at night so we didn't bother much. Thanks again for a great experience Bliss hotel and Singapore."

Bed was comfy, clean room and bathroom. Staff very friendly, this the plus one from the hotel. And location is very very good. Across chinatown point which is really close to MRT station. Last check in i rather disappointed to their hot water, sometimes hot, warm then cold. Then warm again cold. Just like that. despite the negative side, i still listed bliss as my preferred hotel in sgp."

Cons: shower room comes with flat floor and bad drainage hence water flooded bathroom everytime taking shower. Complained and was told that all rooms are like this. Utterly dissapointed with housekeeping quality. Housekeeping staff are so great in keeping me awake every morning by working and chatting laughing so loud along the hallway. While they moved my stuffs during housekeeping, they also only replenished just few amenities, not everything. Bed cover were not properly tidied up and instead just folded into a square. Aircon was sometimes turned off and it took some time to chill when we returned to room. Thanks to the manager, Donald, for his kind assistance and taking all feedback although some of his promises were not delivered by the housekeeping."

This could be improved. The staff was nice about it but the service level could be better improved on weekends.

Room rate is much higher than normal this time as it was the school holidays but still worthwhile as I like the friendly staff, the good location and the big floor areas of the clean and comfortable rooms. Thanks to all the nice staff members who attended to me during my stay there."

We noticed the odour is everywhere in the buiding. - Power points are not universal sockets so we had to buy an adaptor. - Daily buffet breakfast menu is dull - this too needs an uplift. Hotel is understaffed particularly during staycation period. Do expect longer queue to be serve. - Hotel vibe gave this somber mood to us + Room view was great 'City View' + Lifts were quite fast + Club lounge access is 6pm-8pm and all day refreshments are available + Most staff were friendly but some lack customer interaction experience + Hotel location is central to most tourist spots. We mainly walked to places like Chinatown Street Market, Peoples Park, Maxwell Food Centre, Clarke Quay, Bugis Street/ Bugis Junction, Lau Pa Sat hawker centre, Hajii land and Arab lane."

Negative: 1)We asked abt interconnecting / adjoining room and was told by check-in counter staff we need to.pay for to secure one. First time heard of the need to pay extra for adjoining room. 2) Our dad's room (if remember correctly is 6022), the floor carpet at the edge of the bathroom, has 2 or 3 stapler pins sharp ends. Informed but understandably nt rectified immediately, but shld at least put something ontop of the sharps. 3) The same room internet (the router) was real bad affect the ability to watch TV programmes. 4) The same room the bathroom shower tap not user friendly.

The first suite we viewed reeks of smoke smell , and there was only 1 double bed when I have 4 persons, and they suggested to put two single beds into the room. I\u2019ve paid for two rooms and two bathrooms , and they were trying to just up sell us one room?! We rejected the suite and went to check out a normal room 2) so we settled for a normal room but was told that we have to wait for the other room which would be ready by 5 or 530pm. But in e end there was still no call by 630- we had to head down to the reception to ask for the status, and we were still shocked to see that the check in queue was still long, unbelievable 3) state of the room was also old, the shower head holder came out of the wall, the second room that we were given- the tv was not working , and there\u2019s an ancient DVD player- we called the front desk but no one picked up. We wanted to ask for bottled water too- but no one picked up the calls- we called in intervals of 10-15mins , and so we went down to the reception once again- and the staff told us that the lines could be engaged. But the fact was we called multiple times, it\u2019s just not right that someone is actually at the reception, but he\u2019s not picking up the phone. Even a two stars hotel will pick up phone calls no matter what , and that we have to head down just to ask for water Overall, it\u2019s really an unpleasure stay and we will never come back again ."

Maybe it\u2019s time for a refresh Notice that there seems to be lack of manpower for service staff. We need to wait for at least 15 to 20 mins to check in to our room. The last point is the we notice a strange whirring sound which sounded like a heavy traffic along an expressway. The sound apprears like every 10 to 15 minutes. A bit of distracting for those light sleepers. Later we realise it is The Central aircon sound. We stay on level 18 Regards Mr Li"

The person who assisted me for the check in did not show any sign of willingness to accommodate the request. On the second day there was no housekeeping even after requesting for it. They did not even provide the daily share of water. The lady dressed like a manager in the restaurant was very rude on the busier day of my stay. For an instance when a customer approched her for the tissue she just replied buffet closed. I have never seen anyone replying that way in a reputed hotel. Very unprofessional by all means. I would recommend the hotel if you are looking for a cheap 4 star one and don't care about the service. Because there is no service at all."

The rooms are consider big, spacious, large beds and comes with bathtubs and separate showers. My suggestions to hotel management are to refurbish the hotel's lobby, hall rooms, rooms and amenities with new upgrades as well as vibrant colours. The entertainment systems also need to be upgraded, up to date with current technology."

We came here for the pool, but on the day of our check-in the agent told me the pool is not available. I email them in advance about it and the senior agent told me just advice the front desk officer when we do the check-in. Nobody told me or email me in advance that it wasn't available. If I only knew, I cancelled my booking. My kids are disappointed! This hotel is not family friendly, the room so small. The free breakfast is not even a breakfast. The food at the aircraft was better! 2 rooms, suppose to be 4 breakfast but they gave us 2 only. We have to call the frontdesk somemore for it. According to the hotel information the parking is free charge. They have only 2 parking space! My husband parked at the hdb infront and paid per hour! Never again for this hotel. Wasted my money!

In general, I can say that this is a good pick for travellers who want to go to attractions in SG because it is located in the middle of the city. Easy to book grab too from the hotel."

My husband and I had difficulty moving around the room. It was very small. We cannot even open both of our small luggages at the same time. We also booked for a double room but was given twin room. Saying that there\u2019s no available double room when we checked in. \u2b55\ufe0fvery limited TV channels. Nothing interesting on their chosen channels. \u2b55\ufe0f toilet is very small too. No bidet!! \u2b55\ufe0fstaffs were not helpful enough when you need or request something. Good for 1 night stay only, max 2 nights if needed. Recommended for solo travelers only."

Since HGI\u2019s ad on Agoda did not mention any minimum age requirements for check-in, we perceived HGI as OK. Upon arrival, I was denied checking-in due to the misinformation on Agoda (either one of us had to be at least 21 y/o). Waited for three hours there! I called Agoda, regarding this matter but HGI stood firm on its policy even after Agoda intervened. Later on, HGI CANCELLED my reservation without my acknowledgement. Another appalling thing was that the front desk personnel called Nick, told me that I needed a companion who\u2019s 21 y/o & above to check-in with me and even suggested that I ask a random stranger to check-in with me. The horror! HGI Singapore should do better."

He told us that you have to pay your deposit or you will be not get your room access cards. We told him we have not enough cash at that moment and we dont have a credit card. If a debit card, it will take some time to refund back. He told us to draw cash at any atms nearby. So, we did. Then, when we came back with the cash, we saw a very long line of queue at the reception. We approached him and he told us to queue again. And we waited in line for more than half an hour. For goodness sake! You already registered us earlier ago and we have to re-queue.?! So much hassle in the checking in process! Then, we have to wait again for our room."

He also gave us tips on where to get a good local breakfast and the best place to get local currency. The room was spacious enough for a couple. The bed was amazingly comfortable. Location wise, it is perfect to experience the local culture. Surrounded by plenty of delicious food stalls. The staff was always very attentive to your needs.

The only one issue was that I had requested a quiet room; I appreciate it's not always possible to accommodate these requests, but my room was in the Serangoon Tower, right at the end so virtually backed on to the very busy, often noisy main road. Definitely not a quiet room but overall I still enjoyed my stay."

If you happen to choose this hotel because the location is OK and you're right in the heart of Little India, stay in the main building."

Not in the busy centre of little india, and only 2 mins walk to MRT. 5 mins walk to Mustafa center and so many food options around the hotel. The best thing is, this hotel got a 7-11.

We were very early at the hotel and our first positive meeting with the staffs were delightful and warm- it\u2019s like home coming. Then onwards we had delightful positive encounters with staff at the reception, cafeteria, house-keeping supervisor and the security staff who assisted us with our room entry. And above all, we can\u2019t forget the aunty who was mobbing the lift area, when we were about to the lift after breakfast. She stopped her work, wished us with a BIG Smile and waited till the lift doors were almost closed and then carried on with her work. My heartfelt regards to the GM, Ms Jessie for her graciousness and conversation which was simple, enlightening, refreshing making me feel like talking to a good well-known friend. We experienced her positive leadership in the staffs excellent service and left the hotel extremely satisfied."

I do not understand why Dorsett Hotel Staff did not call me on my mobile phone when you notice that my things are still inside my room 604? Also , please understand that my partner returned his Key Card because he needs to leave earlier than me because of his work at around 6am of April 20,2021. He also returned the pool access card that we used on the evening between 9pm to 10pm of April 19,2021. But he did not checked out for us. And , I am still holding my key card and that should trigger your staff that we had not completely checked-out. Besides the booking is under my name. Your staff should had called me also to clarify this. I left the room 604 at around 8:21 am of April 20,2021 to attend an early meeting at my office . And when I returned back to the hotel room , all my things are gone. I felt violated as other people touched my delicates and other things."

Hotel room: Size is not that spacious but still okay at 22m2 as per its website for the basic room. Our booked King bed was actually 2 singles merged into one. Minus a point for not informing us at the reception. Overall room is clean. Bathroom/toilet is very small. First time I ever got \"damaged\" twice while in the toilet during my shower. First my right hand swung onto the bath soap tray during shower and while drying myself outside the shower my back knocked against the metal sharp end of the shower door handle. Fortunately it was not that hard that would cause a deep painful bruise. Lastly the toilet door was not working as well. Staff: I have no issues with anyone. Everyone was very efficient and helpful. Due to the SG Clean status of this hotel, the various procedures to ensure everyone's safety from the pandemic were not that inconvenient at all. Sound out to the front office staffs from Rachel who checked us in as well as the entrance lady who'd explained clearly what we needed to do to enter the hotel premises daily. Facilities: The swimming pool was quite nice. We were only allowed an hour daily and the added step to appear at the front desk just to collect the card pass was slightly inconvenient. Would it not be more useful to allow this set hour to be programmed into our hotel room cards instead of needing to go physically collect it at the reception when using the pool? Another minus half point. Summary: We would come back if we need to go Chinatown again and when the price is as good as what we got."

However, had a not really good experience on my last stay. Not sure if it's the chemical used for washing the bedsheet too strong or what but it triggered my rashes. Didnt really enjoy myself during the 3days stay as i can't sleep and eat well. But overall i will still recommend Lyf to my friends."

One of A Kind room is not bad after all, no TV but it's cozy, suitable for people to do their work from home days. Plenty of restaurants as the hotel is in Funan Mall, you won't die from hunger. There's a huge kitchen pantry for guests to use, you can cook and feel free to use the kitchen's equipment. I would recommend this hotel to young adults to have a good time with their friends. Definitely, not a kid-friendly hotel. I would return though!"

Until I requested physical card keys, they obliged. I was looking forward to the stay but due to the technological glitch, this dampened the staycation.

High tech and modern space. Room was big enough for 1 or possibly 2. Bed was comfy! Like what others have reviewed, pillows can be a little too soft but it was alright for me.

Senior Lyf-Guard (that's what the staff at the concierge are called) namely: Win gave an impeccable service; remembers me by face and name at once, and helped me my e-keycard issue without me needing to give much details as he remembered that i had booked 2 nights under 2 different platforms, and may face that issue. I personally also enjoyed the free photo booth that creates a gif file for you out of 4 photos... had fun with that alone, as well as with my friends who came over to view the property. Only 2 things to feedback for improvement: 1. Hot water took quite sometime to come on, had to run under cold water for 5 minutes before hot water comes out for shower. 2. Wifi Internet speed is super low at times with speed of 13Mbps; quite impossible to get some work done; had to link to my own mobile data to do work instead (good if you are trying to escape from work and have a real staycay, haha). I definitely see myself going back to Lyf again for staycay; looking forward to the next round I can get some off-time. Highly recommended!"

                    "review_comment": "I usually leave reviews not just only to those bad experiences but most definitely for great ones. This is was a trial staycation for me and my wife. We heard from past reviews that they have thin walls and you would hear sirens from SCDF which is right across the street. We still decided to give it a go. When we arrived, we where feel welcome by the team especially those young and tall guys which I think is part of the mgmt team and not the front desk. They set expectation that the check in will have wait time but they are working as fast as they can and to stay in their co-working space infront. After a few minutes it was our turn and they explained everything to us about the stay. The room was high enough as requested. Throughout our stay I would say they have been consistently providing excellent service even to your simple inquiry. I hope they can keep this culture and personality while they are working and while the hotel is in business. The co-spaces are well planned. I was able to work in their co-office space. My was able to spent some time in the gym where they have a human size hamster wheel as substitute for a treadmill. Though we did not use the shared kitchen but I think others will find it useful. As the covid situation here is set to zero we are not being complacent in using shared utensils and kitchenware. The room is wide enough for 2 persons but I still which there are 2 chairs which can accommodate 2 person on their desk to perform work related duties, other than that... there\u2019s no TV, which is good, no fridge.. which we wish it had. The aircon is great... No issues. The toilet is large enough for my big built. They have Shower gel, conditioner and shampoo incase you need to know. Dont forget to download their app. It\u2019ll be useful as a mobile key to your room and other shared spaces. Everyone is great in LYF. We live LYF to the fullest. Thanks for the experience."

It happened yesterday too and I called to reception to complain, I'm not sure whether the noise stop or I eventually fall asleep due to super tired. And it happens again now. It started around 12am but I was doing work so I was hoping it will stop by the time I go to sleep. But sadly it did not, and it is 2 am now. Call to inform the reception at 1.30 am but the noise still there. I guess maybe it is out of their control? The hotel itself is good and the staff are friendly and helpful. The bed is comfortable. But because of the disturbed sleep, I'm really not in the mood to share much on it. I can only give it 5 stars to say that it is really good except my disturbed sleep. Hope the hotel will settle the noises for the following days but I'm saying goodbye to my good night sleep and prepare for a sleepy Friday ..."

When I later ask him back for my NRIC since I saw what he is doing, he even threaten that if I never submit to him my NRIC I will not be able to check-in. Why can't the hotel issue Tickets instead if they are expecting many guests to check in around the same time. Check-in process must be improved!!"

Went the extra mile and met my requirements, the female staff was really helpful and polite. Establishment features were excellent and felt really taken care of. Highly recommended!!! Located on top of Funan Mall makes it really convenient to get stuff and the guidelines of covid-health was adhered. Will visit again soon."

Highly recomended for dont mind the trade offs for price and location with basic aminities and no room services."

Help me with my request and late check out on the next day. The check in process is fast and i love the simplicity of the room and the hotel concept. It is a Staycation for my wedding anniversary, though the hotel do not provide room deco but they help me decorate the chalk board outside of the room and help me write a card which i requested for. Down side is the refrigerator on each level is very small and full but overall happy with the stay."
