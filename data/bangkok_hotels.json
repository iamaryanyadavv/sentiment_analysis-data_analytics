I had a long 30 hours of travel and was guided through check-in, covid test with 2 nurses, and then guided to my room by their many assistants. Quick and easy for how crowded my arrival was. I'd ask others to please be understanding about their covid process. Other customers around me were sometimes not and annoyed at the staff due to the quarantine. Even asked them to rush the results and the quarantine? I got mine back the same day. You still have to quarantine for 24 hours too either way by law... I can easily say this place deals with the process perfectly. Anyway, room service 5-page menu was great and covered 24 hours from good Thai food to burgers. Very reasonable prices for the cheaper options like the usual stir fry. If your room has a washing/dryer machine you get a daily detergent packet which usually is not included other places. Great after having sweaty clothes from the long trip washed and not in your luggage. On checkout I was given all essential documentation in a folder with a take home test if I end up feeling sick. Got brochures on hospitals and pricing. Plenty of documentation provided in the room as well. Would have stayed longer if my travels kept me in town. Will come back!"

Comfortable & very roomy with functional kitchenette & nice extra of a mini washer / dryer Room in the room! Had great views of city skyline downtown & park area, separate bedroom nice, with same nice city skyline views. King bed was nice, but unfortunately the mattress was too firm for my tastes. Strange oddity was the bedroom flooring, not sure why, but the floor was covered with tacky, warped, vinyl sheet covering !! No idea why this was installed & looks completely tacky & out of place with rest of room ? Originally scheduled to stay for 1 night, but had to stay extra night due to on-site covid Pcr test results delayed. Test results delay mostly due to 90+ minute delay in hotel airport transportation pickup !! Hotel advertised Test & Go SHA+ room package, which included airport pickup (hotel limousine) transportation, Pcr & ATK TESTS, + breakfast &. There was one driver scheduled at airport for multiple guests arriving on same flight, hotel was extremely slow in responding to this issue, and had no additional drivers & cars available to handle overflow. Myself and multiple other guests waited almost two hours for ride, & had to make multiple phone calls to hotel just to get a car to transport to hotel. Other than this \u201cglaring oversite\u201d, the hotel & amenities were nice"

Because a lot of the wait was not so smart guests asking dumb questions and making the staff baby them into understanding the rules or what\u2019s needed just like any other customer service job. That\u2019s all the staff is amazing the room is clean and nice the water is super hot the bed is 7/10 comfy American standard. Thai standard it\u2019s like sleeping on a cloud. The chef is good the food I ordered was amazing and it\u2019s location is just borderline perfect because it\u2019s easy to get to and leave in a taxi it\u2019s not right on the busy street it\u2019s down a side street"

Check in was busy (2300hrs) and this resulted in some disappointment when I wanted room service / the hotel offers a much reduced menu and when I eventually got through to room service my requested items were out of stock due to busy demand ! Hmm Shows lack of planning in my view . Food was Ok but very small portions. The arranged Covid test was efficient and professional with results given within 10 hrs . On my check out at noon the following day the queues at reception were a joke , people waiting and getting frustrated , no segregation for check out vs check in quests which was again poor planning as they should anticipate the demand and apportion resources according . As a result I was not given my Covid results or ATK and had to return later to the hotel to ask for the same - appear staffing is an issue al though premises are generally very good . Overall there is room for improvement."

On the next day, I was waiting for my PCR result and waited til I have to call the counter and they inform me that they not sure of my result. I have to check with the nurse which i got to know her inside the plane during the flight to BKK and she informed me that my result was negative. Luckily I added her in my facebook. I think all this can be better arranging and not let customer wait and wait. Waste of time."

The few available staff are, however, very professional and helpful. Just sad to see that such a large hotel with many active guests won't even employ more than 2 active lobby staff (1 courtier and 1 reception staff).

The SHA+ test and go process was seamless upon check in and results were ready by morning as they stated. (Negative and I was off and on my way).

This is especially useful in the heat - you don\u2019t even have to go outside to go grab a bite to eat or grab some essentials. The views are excellent, too. Rooms are not perfect, but the refrigerator and microwave came in handy and complimentary beverages and snacks are a welcome perk.

Hotel room is very spacious and clean. If you need to stay for breakfast or lunch, their menu have 4 items to choose from, way better than most hotels, trust me, this is the third time I come to Thailand with test and go scheme."

With the addition of the new building, BS Grand, the front desk service and condition of the old Premier Wing is very poor. The lobby of the new hotel is beautiful, however, only one receptionist was on duty when the shuttle bus arrived from the airport. With 5 people in front of us, we waited well over 45 min to check-in. Adding vaccination apps to phones and taking pictures slowed the check-in process down. Since we arrived from a nearby city by car, we did not need Thai Pass procedures. In the past, there were 2 people on duty when a shuttle bus arrived. The pools and Premier Restaurant are closed. The view from our Premier room was the old pool filled with green slime. We went into the new pool. A staff member chased us out; the pool was closed because they are a Test & Go hotel. There was no sign saying the pool was closed. The hallways of the Premier Wing were un-swept with debris strewn about. Empty plastic crates blocked easy access to the lift. Dishes with congealed food by a neighbouring room were left outside the door for several hours. The floor of the lift was very dirty. To order dinner, we were told to order at reception and it would be brought to tables outside the lobby. Over half an hour later, still no food. The kitchen did not receive our order. We left to find a meal nearby. Although we had planned plenty of time for a meal and shower before leaving for the airport, that time was cut short. We then had to rush. The only plus side of our stay was that the Superior Room was the same cleanliness and comfort as before. As regular Suvarnabhumi travellers, we will be finding another airport hotel. It is so sad to see that an SHA++ upgrade resulted in a downgrade of service."

Which made me decide to call and call and call again until they do pickup. That made them turn off the phone instead of picking up. I was in the need of medical assistance but got fully ignored by the people at yhe lobby. Whe I confronted the staff about this they just laughed and said, did not want to phone....

The staff did not mention earlier before my travel date so I can decide what to do. The PCR test isn't taken in hotel but in hospital instead. The entire arrangement isn't convenient enough. No meals will be given, only 2 bottle of drinking water provided during my stay, no drinking water for second day. Waited PCR test result for so long, even ridiculous, the staff called me and asked me whether when I would like to checkout, then I have to tell them where is my PCR result, only then they gave me the result.

The hotel struggled to deal with Room Service orders, as we were not allowed to leave the room. It took almost 3 hours to get some food and drink, although when it arrived it was very good. After we got our negative test results we were able to have a walk around the local area that has some markets and shops. The hotel provided us with a free mini-bus transfer back to the airport for our domestic flight to Koh Samui the next morning."

The TV only has about 10 stations and only two in English. I can't comment on how this would be for a long term stay but it is near the Ratchaprsong and Pratunam shopping areas and not far from the BTS station at Chit Lom. The room service menu leaned towards Thai and there were no breakfast options although I don't know what is available in thee restaurant. as there is usually a buffet in the morning."

For breakfast buffet, there are not much choices of food. Not something to look forward for in the morning. The bacon is also limited. For the facilities, we went for a night swim and a friend of mine stepped on a shard of glass beside the pool area. There were droplets of blood everywhere and her injury was pretty bad. What\u2019s worse was the staffs are unprepared for emergencies as such. It took around 20 mins before the \u201cfirst aid\u201d came to help.

We booked one day quarantine and PCR package which includes airport pickup, PCR test and dinner, breakfast and lunch. Our names were not there for pick up and it took ages for us to get transport sorted. Check in has long queue even at 7:00 pm. So did check out. I mentioned transport issues receptionist ignored. Room was really good and so was location. We were starving after 14 hrs flight and couldn\u2019t stop or go anywhere before hotel due to quarantine, called multiple times for dinner they got a box with 10 noodles with 3 shrimp and hand full of leaves. None of us ate despite being hungry as food had hair in it, appetites totally lost. PCR test was done in the room by someone around 9:30 pm and they promised to call us by 5:00am to let us know results. No contact till 12:00 pm next day and we called reception no results yet at which point we were getting anxious\u2026,.they gave us results while we were checking out 3 days later. Despite so many good things service and staff totally let us down"

Breakfast is ok, but if you eat breakfast there for too many days, it gets to trivial, since the creativity is to be desired..... Would I come back..... For sure I will, you can book a great room for approx. half of the price you would pay elsewhere for the same quality...... Cant wait to come back, Thank you Berkeley for 7 wonderful days........"

The hotel differentiated - 1500 Baht for the accommaodation , 3200 Baht for the T&G package. This included individual transport from the aiprort (ok); a PCR test (ok but only conducted late in the evening) and 3 meals. Those meals were delivered to the room but the food was not even street food level in plastic containers and always cold. Why can\u00b4t it be normal room service conditions? Money enough would have been left after you take the anticipated costs for the taxi and the PCT test off. Ver disappointed. Ahh. almost forgot. The \"luxury\" room had only one small window (different to the photos on agoda) and was not better than any 3-star hotel I\u00b4ve been too.

Lights are controlled by a controller by the bed, there are no switches so you cannot turn on the bathroom lights when you get up at night. Also, turning off all the lights turns off the outlets too! So you can't charge your phone or use the TV with the lights off. The TV didn't work well, the controller kept breaking. The furniture is dated and they don't provide slippers or a way to reheat food. No iron or ironing board in the room as well, but we ordered one from housekeeping. Only the pool was open and there was no ala carte breakfast (only buffet). Room service ends at 8pm! Location is great near all the big malls and the staff are pleasant. Just needs some major upgrades. You can probably find a better option elsewhere, but this place was inexpensive for the location (at the time of booking Dec. 2021)"

Downsides: - Tried to contact property via Agoda/ email regarding my booking but there wasn't any response. Finally managed to speak with someone over FB messenger and replies were prompt there."

At check-in they required an extra 1000 baht deposit, which they will return at checkout. After getting the room keys, I went for the pcr test within the hotel. Once that was done, I went up to my room where I had to stay until I received a call from the staff the next morning to say my result was negative (around 10am). After check out, I was free to go. Day 5-7 after arrival, I have to go get my 2nd pcr test at one of the designated test centers. Keep in mind that meals are not included unlike some other hotels (unless you pick the package that includes breakfast)."

The hotel is clean and tidy, but lacks warmth, this lack of warmth was also found with the reception staff, who never once asked if they can be of any assistance. No nice smiles or engagement in any conversation. Quite stiff & robotic really. The hotel appears to cater for less European travellers and maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing. However, my experience at the Avani riverside has always been nothing other than fabulous. I\u2019m a frequent flyer with years of experience in hotels, so this review is based on that. Hence for my family & friends I would not recommend. I\u2019m sure there are other hotels that would make you feel more welcome. Please don\u2019t base this review on the virus as the week before we stayed at the Avani so that can not be used as an excuse for lack of engagement."

However, Many ppl walk at the hallway and sometimes is quite noisy at the morning. The location is a bit far away from the BTS but the shuttle service is good. Need to provide more shuttle bus to other sightseeing place. The swimming pool is ok, but too many kids playing at the swimming pool and the water is quite cold. The spa service is ok but the hotel discount should be the same as the online discount. Also, the Onsen should be free at least 1 day for the customers who stay at the hotel for more than 2 days. The breakfast buffet is ok but no hot beverages such as Thai tea provided, also no coconut drink. However, mango sticky rice and fish cake is provided."

The rooms are no bigger than the bed, once your bag is in the room it has to go behind the door which is a fire hazard. It is severely claustrophobic. It is super unclean, not hygienic, the floor has dirty footprints all over it, the bed had black hairs all over it(I took photos), i will see if I can attach photos (I am bald and hairless basically so they aren't mine). No safety guidelines adhered to, the lobby is closet sized and had 6 people in it coughing when I arrived. The airport transport they organized tried to extort another 1000 baht from me because i had two bags of luggage, There is no one to complain too and the hotels can extort whatever charges they want from you, as W 21 did to me, as there is no authority managing the SHA program....trust me I tried the AOT and the airport information desk they cannot help and the manager of the cars said to me, \"I will make you sit until midnight and then you will pay.\" At 1:40am the hotel reception phoned me to threaten me not to post a negative review of the situation suggesting they would not give me my Covid test results. AVOID this hotel at all costs, it is not worth it whatsoever. Definitely the worst hotel in Thailand."

Upon arrival (after the immigration process), I was greeted by one of the officers. You may simply provide your name and the name of the hotel and he/she will contact the driver to take you for the drive thru PCR test and to the hotel afterward. It was a nice ride! After arrival at the hotel, you cannot go outside and need to remain inside your room until the receptionist calls you about the PCR result. Expect to receive the call within 7 hours (mine was under that), really quick! After that, you may go anywhere you want. They didn\u2019t serve meals for you so, you have to buy your meal before your arrival. Just take note of that! However, I do hope the hotel manager will improve the email communication as sometimes they are not too responsive when comes to replying to my inquiries. But all is forgiven considerating I had a wonderful one night there."

Not great but for a budget location not horrible. The location is quite good because it is close to the mall where you can purchase sim card and to a Super Rich where you can exchange your currency.

I booked a small room for this short period of time. I knew it would be small and I knew it would just have a small window but this was my choice and it completely fulfilled my requirements. The room was very clean, AC and the shower worked fine and the bed was comfy. So that I can recommend this hotel 100% for short time quarantine. Hopefully Test&Go will come back soon!"

However, my compliments stop here. Many things in the room were in need of repair. The safe was completely unusable, the swing function of the air-con was not working, unreliable hot water stream (hot then turned cold), the toilet flushing system leaked water, toilet door scraped the floor and the freezer in the fridge was practically one block of ice and I guess the light bulb was frozen in the ice (hence no light). I didn\u2019t bother to request for repair or change of room because my stay wasn\u2019t long. Much had been said about the lift by other guests in their reviews. I was fortunate to have legs strong enough to climb the stairs to 4th floor where my room was. Perhaps there were better rooms in W12. (I am sorry, W12) But for now, I won\u2019t recommend the hotel based on my experience in the room that was unfortunately not too good."

The main problem is the 1 foot step up to the bathroom which as an elderly person who needs to go to the toilet at night, its dangerous. There was also no kettle to make tea. The room was very dark indeed and having read previous reviews, i paid extra for a window which was very small and would help if they could somehow clean it. The walls were brown. Fortunately, i was out most of the time. I have stayed in much better accommodation for similar price but the location sells this hotel to me. The receptionist was very friendly."

This place seems newly renovated - it's clean and bright and the doorman and reception are very nice. The elevator is neat, clean and worked fine, The room I had on L4 was at the rear and quiet, had only a narrow window but sufficient light. The shower/toilet is narrow too but sufficient for my needs - good heat and towels are provided. There is a tiny basin. The shower did leak slightly into the floor slightly. The bed is queen size on a platform w storage underneath was comfortable. The walkable area of the room is 1.2m wide and if you had a large suitcase, it may be a problem. The 50cm platform between the foot of the bed and the TV could be used for a small luggage. The hair dryer wasn't working and the reception and she said she would take care of it but it never happened in the 4D3N I was there. Would stay again."

It\u2019s a modern hotel but without guests the hard furnishings make it look stark, barren and bleak. The hotel was virtually empty but they put me in a room at the back overlooking a construction site. The TV channel options were rubbish only the BBC news channel was worth watching, no movie or entertainment channels, maybe they are saving money on TV subscriptions?? The Wi-Fi signal was good but kept dropping out. I was the only guest in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast, the food was mediocre and Luke warm. The pumpkin soup I had as a starter for dinner was tasteless and breakfast the next day was pretty naff and at 3 star standard of choice and taste. I was really looking forward to a 5 star breakfast. The free mini bar was a packet of chips, a packet of nuts, a coke and a small box of juice. Two saving points the location, near by the Irish Embassy and the BTS and the helpfulness of the check in staff."

When the sun comes up, the room will be very bright so it wasn't good for people who don't usually wake up in the morning. Then there is also the construction and traffic noise. The room is not sound proof, had it been sound proof the room would have been close to perfect. Every morning around 6AM the traffic noise is too loud that I tend to wake up and not have a perfect 8 hour sleep. I would definitely return but I rather choose the room that is furthest away from traffic."

We stayed in both and found out hugh different. This hotel's entrance locates at a main road with very heavy traffic like a highway. First we were attracted by its images so we booked two nights, but disappointed upon arrival. Pros: Friendly reception staffs and grand lobby, the sofa and colour tone in the room are comfortable. Cons: - Two narrow small single beds in our room with no more than 75-90cm(w), don't match with its lobby and price; - Construction site where room balcony was facing, could hear machinery noise & can hardly read a book on the balcony bench; - The journey between Ploenchit BTS station and hotel entrance is quite unpleasant, despite noise and smell from heavy vehicles, the bridge walkway of staton exit and the road is only connected by a LONG narrow metal staircase, had seen many family travellers struggled with luggage and small kids."

The apartment itself was not bad, decently furnished with 2 small balconies mostly occupied by the air conditioning units but still can go out to take fresh air. This is not our first quarantine in Bangkok so I have ground to compare. The food quality had nothing to do with what we had during our previous quarantines. Though there was a menu with 4 choices, the food photos on the menu had nothing to do with the reality. The portions were small and the quality of food was low. It was delivered from somewhere at random, sometimes odd times. For example, lunch between 12pm and 2 pm, dinner between 6 and 8 pm. One day they even forgot to bring us lunch and when we called, they found some excuses with the hotel from which the were ordering the food. Then they sent us one Cesar salad consisting of 3-4 lettuce leaves and some bread crumps. The box was labelled for other room - probably some leftover. For paying 11,000+ THB per night, everyone will expect better service. But the biggest issue was after we checked out. We received the PCR test results at checkout but they did not give us the Release letters. I wrote them 4 times including all 5 email addresses, from the initial booking email exchange. All my emails were complete ignored, none of the 5 email address replied anything. The release letters are important, as they are usually requested by the employer or if you want stay in another hotel, they will ask you to present the release letter at check-in. But apparently the guys from Aspira Hana do not care. I wonder how they managed to get their AQ license as this release letter is mandatory to issue. Anyway, I will never book any hotel from the Aspira chain."

Well yes they do have, but they are Recesed into the room and occupied by Two Air conditioners, but there is No view anyway, only overlooks back yards and roofs of old buildings down a little alleyway off Surkhamvit Road. So all in all it served its purpose to promote Cabin Fever but I would'nt recommend it for Tourists long Stay . But hey...you get what you pay for."

I complained to reception, but they could not stop the work, as the owner of the hotel had mandated it. This is typical of smaller hotels in Thailand where the staff are not informed of decisions made by arrogant uncaring owners and we all have to endure the inconvenience of their thoughtless decisions. The noise from the work drove us all crazy and there was nothing we could about it! Most frustrating!"

Cold Pad Thai for lunch and as a diner 10(!) cold french fries with 2 cold mini toasts in a plastic container accompanied with a can of coke Mind the micro wave wasn't functioning. To get this served with a 150GBP nightly rate is ridiculous. Good food isn't expensive in Thailand. a shame and bad first impression for anyone who makes an effort to visit Thailand."

My only complaint is the air quality. The floor we are on and our room smell like mold. I suspect it\u2019s the air conditioning units.

All are very important when you are effectively confined to your room. Aspira Hana had pre-ordered western food for my first day - it's the standard Thai idea of what western food might be. But now I'm making my own choices, Thai food is much better. Excellent fresh fruit every day too. Bring your own cutlery and crockery or have a friend deliver it for you. Otherwise it's all plastic disposable."

The quarantine measures are implemented very well here. Our booked suite is nicely furnished and has everything you need for 14 days. The rooms are very clean and tidy. The food can be selected from four different offers per meal on the previous day and is really very tasty, varied and plentiful. Plates and cutlery are available in the mini kitchen and, if necessary, the food can be reheated in the microwave. the kitchen staff also sends fruit and an additional salad to the room every day, sometimes even ice cream. I am very pleasantly surprised by the hotel crew, in times of the corona pandemic, and I feel safe and in good hands. 5 stars from me for the hotel team and the quarantine package"

The space - I had a suite with a bedroom and a kitchen / living room, Im so glad that I booked the extra space. It was a real game changer for my productivity, rather than spending a lot of time on my bed. The food - the 2 - 3 local restaurants that delivered daily meals had good tasty food options for the 2 weeks, Id prefer some extra vegetable or fruit options (I eat a lot of them) but that's me. The service - the support staff and especially Tian, who was my main point of contact, were fantastic. Clear communication and always happy to help me to get what I needed. Overall - I'd highly recommend as a ASQ, especially in this price range plus I will stay again the next time I am spending time here in Bangkok."

So it is quite abnormal and inconvenient, wishing all of us could stay away from Covid 19, would be very keen to return ing to Hana Residence soon."

The bed was surprisingly big enough to fit all of us? Thought someone was going to take the couch! There were even 2 TVs with Netflix installed. On google maps it says to drive into Thonglor Soi 25, but go into Soi 23 better. 7/11 and main Thonglor road a short walk from the apartment. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Limited parking and we didn\u2019t get a chance to check out the pool and gym upstairs. Will be back!"

While I was told the room I was given was of equal value, I do not think it matched this room at the Thong Lo.

The bathtub is possibly the best I've ever had in my 22 years of traveling. The staff are all friendly & awesome."

I had a long 30 hours of travel and was guided through check-in, covid test with 2 nurses, and then guided to my room by their many assistants. Quick and easy for how crowded my arrival was. I'd ask others to please be understanding about their covid process. Other customers around me were sometimes not and annoyed at the staff due to the quarantine. Even asked them to rush the results and the quarantine? I got mine back the same day. You still have to quarantine for 24 hours too either way by law... I can easily say this place deals with the process perfectly. Anyway, room service 5-page menu was great and covered 24 hours from good Thai food to burgers. Very reasonable prices for the cheaper options like the usual stir fry. If your room has a washing/dryer machine you get a daily detergent packet which usually is not included other places. Great after having sweaty clothes from the long trip washed and not in your luggage. On checkout I was given all essential documentation in a folder with a take home test if I end up feeling sick. Got brochures on hospitals and pricing. Plenty of documentation provided in the room as well. Would have stayed longer if my travels kept me in town. Will come back!"

Had great views of city skyline downtown & park area, separate bedroom nice, with same nice city skyline views. King bed was nice, but unfortunately the mattress was too firm for my tastes. Strange oddity was the bedroom flooring, not sure why, but the floor was covered with tacky, warped, vinyl sheet covering !! No idea why this was installed & looks completely tacky & out of place with rest of room ? Originally scheduled to stay for 1 night, but had to stay extra night due to on-site covid Pcr test results delayed. Test results delay mostly due to 90+ minute delay in hotel airport transportation pickup !! Hotel advertised Test & Go SHA+ room package, which included airport pickup (hotel limousine) transportation, Pcr & ATK TESTS, + breakfast &. There was one driver scheduled at airport for multiple guests arriving on same flight, hotel was extremely slow in responding to this issue, and had no additional drivers & cars available to handle overflow. Myself and multiple other guests waited almost two hours for ride, & had to make multiple phone calls to hotel just to get a car to transport to hotel. Other than this \u201cglaring oversite\u201d, the hotel & amenities were nice"

Then while in quarantine, I ordered room service and I was told that it would arrive in 30 minutes. After 1 hour, it still didnt arrive and when I called again, I was told that they would leave it outside the door. I probed when, was told 5 minutes. I had to wait another 20 minutes for it to arrive. How could this be a 5 star service?"

Because a lot of the wait was not so smart guests asking dumb questions and making the staff baby them into understanding the rules or what\u2019s needed just like any other customer service job. That\u2019s all the staff is amazing the room is clean and nice the water is super hot the bed is 7/10 comfy American standard. Thai standard it\u2019s like sleeping on a cloud. The chef is good the food I ordered was amazing and it\u2019s location is just borderline perfect because it\u2019s easy to get to and leave in a taxi it\u2019s not right on the busy street it\u2019s down a side street"

Check in was busy (2300hrs) and this resulted in some disappointment when I wanted room service / the hotel offers a much reduced menu and when I eventually got through to room service my requested items were out of stock due to busy demand ! Hmm Shows lack of planning in my view . Food was Ok but very small portions. The arranged Covid test was efficient and professional with results given within 10 hrs . On my check out at noon the following day the queues at reception were a joke , people waiting and getting frustrated , no segregation for check out vs check in quests which was again poor planning as they should anticipate the demand and apportion resources according . As a result I was not given my Covid results or ATK and had to return later to the hotel to ask for the same - appear staffing is an issue al though premises are generally very good . Overall there is room for improvement."

On the next day, I was waiting for my PCR result and waited til I have to call the counter and they inform me that they not sure of my result. I have to check with the nurse which i got to know her inside the plane during the flight to BKK and she informed me that my result was negative. Luckily I added her in my facebook.

The few available staff are, however, very professional and helpful. Just sad to see that such a large hotel with many active guests won't even employ more than 2 active lobby staff (1 courtier and 1 reception staff).

Our hot water doesnt work and even though the technician came to fix it for us, it failed again after 10mins so we just gave up. I switched to a different hotel once i received my negative PCR test result. Overall if you are just looking for a 1 night stay to fulfil the SHA requirement then they do a very good job in that regard.

The hotel is extremely central yet very quiet. The overall hotel service is great. The helpfulness of the staff at this hotel is second to none. You can tell that there is a well-coordinated team working here under an internationally experienced management. I have been traveling, living and working in Asia for over 35 years. When our two credit cards suddenly stopped working for technical reasons, the hotel director Khun Ice - who, by the way, speaks fluent German and English in addition to Thai - offered to take us to our bank to find a solution. The next day Khun Ice went with us to the bank (!) and invested over 3 hours of his valuable time in our problem. Just one day later, Khun Ice called us in our room and asked us to come to the hotel restaurant, where a bank employee handed us two new cards. Problem solved. Without Khun Ice we would have been helpless. I have never experienced such helpfulness in over 35 years. Again, dear Khun Ice, from the bottom of my heart many, many thanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f for your help! For us, the hotel and its staff is the very first choice. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f for such a wonderful time. We will definitely come again! \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18"

I mean, worlds are colliding as it is a first for anyone of us travelers under these times to be exposed to a foreign country\u2019s set of rules. Just as the rules at home, the local rules here are floating, too. Take it easy and let it happen. I mean lean back relax, let the staff, the driver etc. take the lead and in most of the cases you won\u2019t be disappointed. In general, as many steps of data processing etc. are very creatively executed with free available social media apps, it seems a little bit chaotic here, but it works out beautifully at the end. The people are all doing a great job to make the \u201ctest and go scheme\u201d work. To be honest, I have seen worse at a Narita airport arrival last month in Japan. Moreover, the PCR test results to be forwarded to the hotel are on time. If you arrive in the evening just check with receptionist next morning before you go to breakfast and get a big smile back. The hotel is renovated. I do not know if all rooms are renovated, but my room was very ok! Apart from the notorious complainers, I could not find anything annoying at all. I had a great stay here!

The only good thing about this hotel is the cafeteria. So if you looking for a good place to rest after the long flight, this hotel is definitely not for you. Spend little more money and find a good cleaner hotel to stay."

The rooms are big and good value for the money.l but they are very poorly cleaned and it is full of dust, moldy water marks and the policy of the complimentary water is just horrible.

This issue was resolved quickly after talking to the front desk staff and they apologized, but it didn\u2019t seem like something rare. The new room had been cleaned but the standard of cleanliness is rather low, no western standard. I wasn\u2019t sure if the sheets had been changed at all. We had to call the front desk and ask for our test results, otherwise they would have called - the results had been laying around for a while. Breakfast was a joke. We left one day early. At checkout, we had to ask for the already payed ATK Test and if we hadn\u2019t asked for it, we also wouldn\u2019t have gotten the printed PCR test results that apparently we will need for upload in the Morchana app. I would recommend choosing a different place to stay.

My other complaint is it took a little over 16 hours to get my test results and when I called down to the front desk the lady hung up and when I called back 15 minutes later because i thought maybe it was disconnected, she answered saying she was busy checking in other people and will call me back in 10 minutes with the results. I waited another hour for her return before calling down again, and this time a much friendlier guy answered and looked up my results right there and told me I was free to go! I did have a wonderful massage there and breakfast was good! Overall I would not book here again or recommend since everyone I talked to that didn\u2019t stay at this hotel Day 1 about how long it took to receive their test results said 4-5hours and were given the test results and uploaded to the app. (Every hotel I\u2019ve stayed at since has had to call and verify my results due to this mishap)."

And in room even though I booked for 2 people QUARANTINE there were no amenities at all. They only kept one small water bottle. For quarantine meals the menu was not kept in room..had to call the operator several times to get it.. for dinner when we wanted to order food..none of the hotel lines were answering. I card reception, operator, room service but no one answered. What were they expecting the guest in quarantine to eat? Toilet water? To put it short DONT BOOK THIS HOTEL .. there are so many better hotels at lower price."

We were given another room which was lovely but the bathroom was covered in mould. After 7pm room service ended so you had to order food via the grab app and the staff would bring it up as you couldn\u2019t leave the room. The food was delivered but all hotel phones we rung e.g the front desk were turned off and we had to get in touch via the spa. The following day no one told us that our PCR results were available so we had to go outside and ask the cleaner to get in touch with the front desk as the phones in our room still didn\u2019t work. The room was nice but I wouldn\u2019t stay there regarding covid testing, we were also guaranteed water but we were only given two small bottles between two of us in 24 hours."

Unfortunately it was impossible to reach reception using the phone in the room, so I had to go down to ask, even thought I technically wasn't allowed to leave the room. Also, my Thailand Pass registration was slowed down because of them. As for the room, it was spacious, but it has definitely seen better times."

Daily make up room is consistent. However, there are few things that we need to point out: 1. Communication. There should be someone who will be assigned to receive calls/emails for clients concerns. I know that we are still in a pandemic and you receive a lot of calls and emails. But as for the clients perspective, it is important that you are prompt to respond, give updates and be pro-active. Prior our stay, we really have a hard time of reaching out to you and on our end, its kind of frustrating. As a client, we need assurance and everything. 2. Staff. We forgot to get the names of all of your Staff but we would like to commend the guy who is very accommodating from the day we arrived and all throughout our stay. We also want to commend the lady staff assigned at around 9pm onwards. She is really accommodating. However, we would like to point out this lady assigned at around afternoon (time is around between 3pm to 8pm). She is not accommodating as others. She doesn't have any eagerness to give us anything. All she do is that this and that and its final. I remember we really need our RT-PCR result the soonest since we are flying back in our country the next early morning, she even told us that the result will just come out the following day. So what we do since she is not helpful at all, we just go to the hospital itself at midnight and follow up our result on ourselves. That's frustrating. 3. Checking-Out. We don't have much problem on this. 4. Breakfast. Food in the buffet is good. 5. Wifi/Internet. Not stable. Not recommended if you're working remotely or if you have meetings."

Having arrived at 11pm at night i was told to turnup at reception at 7am for the covid test which if i do, the result will be delivered at 4pm the next day. Results came negative and i ran to the exit door because the palace is like a haunted dead hotel and nobody besides you can be spotted. so yeah, very much like the jail time at the hotel because the 2 guards can spot the very few people that enter and exit. I would never book this hotel even if it is test-n-go."

Only the poor dude at the entrance in covid protection suit was friendly and motivated. I mean, we are all suffering from the situation. Also, I have been travelling in asia a lot. But, still, this hotel was not worth the money even considering all the circumstances. Lets hope they will do better when the pamdemic is over."

The hotel is currently under reconstruction, which is why everything is a bit improvised currently. The hotel staff barely speaks English, when checking in, they treated us as if we were definitely infected, we couldn't ask any questions, were given one meal at 5pm and then breakfast (similar meal to the day before, cold, dry, likely prepared the night before). For the second night, we got some food from a nearby restaurant and a 7 eleven around the corner. The room itself is ok, clean, the beds are confortable, the bathroom is fine, however there is only one hook for all towels, the aircon doesn't get rid of the humidity from the bathroom/showers we took. They are using one of the two bedside tables to deposit the meals in front of the door. For our first night, the hotel staff was very quick in sending our booking confirmation and quarantine documents.. For the second night however, they replied a day before our flight and not until we had some local friends call them, knowing that we had to apply for our Thailand-Pass still. The organization of this hotel a bit messy. It's an option for the Test&Go program, but prepare before you enter the hotel. If you arrive at the hotel in the late afternoon, you'll get your results at 11am (sometimes before)"

Employees don't speak English, there is no bar and no room service, despite all these things appeared to be included. If you try to talk to reception- good luck! They are extra rude and unhelpful. Getting them on the phone is a jackpot. They couldn't even provide us a lighter. 4 star hotel has no matches or lighter for guest mostly comming by an airplane. As of 4th of Feb, the pool is closed as well. If we knew, we would never purchase this package."

We were put on the 14th floor with the rest of the quarantine guests, the pcr test on arrival was very efficient though and results were given by 6am the next morning by phoning down to reception. The food that we was given was stone Cold and we had to phone reception 5 times before we were brought some food, also we were given bath mats for towels. Please avoid this hotel unless you really have to stay here, we were deceived but didn\u2019t have much choice as it was a last minute booking."

There are many other dental clinics there, but BIDC was the first internationally accredited one in Thailand and we got great service there two years ago. The Cha-da is almost directly across the street, just a hop up the overpass and you're there. It's also not far from the subway (MRT). Additionally, it''s near the Thai Cultural Center and numerous other interesting places. It has a nice rooftop pool, however, it's not as well cared for as it could be and is actually too cold to enjoy without some discomfort. The rooms are nice, clean and well appointed even if a tad small. The included breakfast though is definitely a stand-out, better than 95% of hotel breakfasts. At $45 a room, overall it's worth the money. DRC"

Staff were super friendly and I have nothing against them. Pick up from airport and covid testing was seamless. However when I arrived to the room the bedsheets were a bit dirty. The walls of the room as very thin so you can hear everything happening in the corridor. The rooms had this annoying door bell which the staff would use to get your attention when they left the meals outside the door since you are supposed to have as little contact as possible. The food was okay but breakfast was served at 6:30am in the morning! I was so jet lagged that I couldn\u2019t even eat at this time but they also wouldn\u2019t let me sleep properly. I\u2019m a light sleeper which doesn\u2019t help but when I didn\u2019t answer the doorbell for lunch (at 11am) they rang multiple times and woke me up. I wish they served meals later or wouldn\u2019t ring the bell. The food was okay although a bit spicy and no dietary requirements were asked beforehand so I had to phone reception to find out if the food contained gluten / pork as I can\u2019t eat either. Having said that everything else was clean, air con was great, wifi was great, staff were great. I wouldn\u2019t stay here again but I don\u2019t regret doing it for the hotel quarantine"

It's just apparently their policy to prey on travelers and refuse any kind of modification. Basically, if you have a problem and arrive a few hours or a day late, tough luck, they will run away with your money and you won't get your room. My story : flight got delayed, wanted to have a room the next day instead, they refused and slammed me with a \"no refund, no modification\" email and then stopped replying whatsoever.

The room and the bathroom were very clean and the concierge offered to go to the local convenience store for me, whilst I had to stay in the room, awaiting the clearance from the covid testing result. In summary a good hotel to choose for the first night and Thailand Pass covid testing, after arriving in Bangkok from an international flight. I would also stay at the hotel again if visiting Bangkok and not requiring the first night airport transfer and testing package provided the rate was competitive with the other local hotels."

The room I was in (800b per night) had a very comfy bed, decent sized TV (a few western channels), desk area, wardrobe with safe box, mini fridge (not working), and coffee station. Window, but no real view. Wifi connection was solid - each room has its own router. Swimming pool looked like it was just being brought back on line. Food at the hotel is good quality and good sized portions. Unfortunately though, the restaurant is no longer open for buffet breakfast, which I had enjoyed in past years. Meals are brought to the room, with a 20 to 30 minute delivery time."

There's a huge sloping window, fitted with a 'blackout' blind it just doesn't keep the sun out, so by 6:30am, the sun is lighting up the room. Very clean, although with the 'nee normal', the rooms are now only cleaned every 2 days on our 4th day I had to ask for cleaning, fresh towels and bed linen changing 3 times before anyone came at 17:15. We paid a very low price for this room, but the issues would have been there even if we had paid the full price. The Club Lounge is closed, but you can go to 'Lobby bar and tea room' instead. It's ok. But nowhere near as pleasant as the Club Lounge was. We were given tepid chicken nuggets with floppy fries with our drinks on our first evening. Not up to standard at all, but the staff are wonderful, always helpful and very pleasant. I'm sure that when things calm down with the virus, the PP will be up there with the best once again. Overall, they're doing a great job."

I booked as an anniversary surprise and when I told my other half where we were going, she called the hotel and had them add a dinner table in our room and set up flowers and decorations - all on the morning we were set to arrive! They were super nice and even kept a straight face when we checked in. We ordered dinner from their restaurant and were very pleased. The next morning, they delivered breakfast straight to our room and it was huge! This was a little staycation for us so it was really nice to have MBK Center literally attached to the hotel to take a little stroll. The mall was mostly closed due to partial lockdown, but it was really cool to be able to take the elevator from your room practically down to the mall entrance. I will definitely be back because it was surely a romantic view from the room as well."

Due to the Pandemic, the price is good, for the 2 stays, we opt for the Horizontal Suite, and Executive Suite respectively to enjoy the big room, even with a discount rate, Pathumwan Princess maintain a very high standard. Their staffs are very well trained and speak good English. We are vegetarian, and for breakfast, they able to customize our food. The room is clean and well maintain. The shower though pressure is relatively weak, but the temperature of the water is easy to control. Pathumwan Princess has the best Sport facility, probably they are operate separately but allow Hotel guest to use the facilities. The minus point being non-Hotel guests are sharing the same lift who went to the 8 floor where the sport facilities and pool are. The pool side is one of the best I have encounter for many Hotel I stay in Bangkok. Overall, I will return, and this Hotel is highly recommended."

At the very first, i suppose your hotel is famous and has good credit hotel in BKK, thus i ask for the naive help to your staff for receiving my parcels during my stay. Via FB message, i thought it was the common way to send my request. While the first parcel your staff declines to receive, after i inquire AGAIN, they finally receive my parcel. Another 2 parcels, your staff asks me about the tracking number, i am so naive that to believe your staff woild take care, that quoted dialogue from your staff, \"Now, We have got only 1 parcel sir , May I have your reference parcel ID after that I will check from kerry for you.\" I reply it is sent by flash express.  Your staff seemed to be very much busy, until i found 2 parcels were missing, your staff stated to try to fix it. Until i checked out, there are still one parcel lost.  I found that your hotel got problem on showing calling numer corrrectly (Which the wrong siuation is still ongoing), that is the reason the courier could not contact the front desk very well. And your staff, wants to rectify me that it was my main problem. Now once, even if i check out, your staff still insists that i am wrong. I am not asking your staff or your hotel to compensate my lost, but for the future if you could make it correct, might decrease the problem for sure.  As a guest, i feel insulted by telling your hotel the right thing. What if i am the technician of your hotel,it would still insult me my finding? - For the period without air conditioning. Your staff and related workers are trying to fix the supposed circumstances very hard, i admiire your hard work.  Also, your thoughtful idea to let guests live in other hotel, is very good measure. However, your staff changes the wording 4-5 times for the fixing time.  If we still stay the arranged hotel, in my opinion, n"

Hotel has nice ideals like environmental friendly features like in room filtered water dispenser and auto power off features when no one is detected to be in room. However, that also means that the dehumidifier feature in the bathroom doesn\u2019t work. So bathroom will have to be aired for around 15 minutes every time I stepped out.

Firstly, the pool tiles and jacuzzi drains were covered in green slimey mould. The pool area is fabulous in all respects but this mould needs to be cleaned up, it\u2019s very off putting. Also, for some reason the hostess at breakfast seemed to get very annoyed if we didn\u2019t sit where she wanted to put us, the almost empty breakfast area was spacious and we preferred to sit where the American breakfast is served rather that the Asian Side which smelled of strange flavours that we didn\u2019t like. We also saw a cockroach on the breadboard and breadbasket which they quickly got rid of. Most of the staff were lovely but this young lady made us feel very uncomfortable. We visit many 5* resorts so know what the standard is. When I was ill one morning and asked if I could have a plain bread roll and a banana bought up to my room, it seemed too much trouble even though I\u2019d paid for bed and breakfast."

While the service could be improved (i.e to explain why only 1 room card was given before being questioned since it is due to lack of cards and informing us to check in at 3pm but not having the room ready at 4.20pm or putting 2 single beds together and calling it a king sized bed), the staff are sincere and polite all the time. The location was great as it is linked to MBK, Siam Centre, Siam Paragon and BTS station. It is very convenient if you are taking ARL from airport. The gym is however opened to locals and they bring their own locks, making it impossible for the hotel guests to use the locker that was allocated. Overall, it was clean and comfortable and the breakfast spread is amazing and value for money."

Firstly, the bath tub height and the towel rack heights are placed too high and it's certainly not conducive for Asians for the obvious reason. I am 1.6 ft tall by the way. In addition, there are no grab bars to make getting in and out of the bath tub easier. Hence it is prone to slips and falls especially for older folks. Hope the hotel can consider this aspect seriously. Secondly, guests can only use the steps up and down from the lobby to the breakfast area it seems. I hope the hotel can improvise this area so that it can be wheel-chair friendly and for some older folks who may have problem climbing up and down the steps. This hotel excels in cleanliness and location. But regrettably I will not be staying here in future if the facilities are not improvised to be more senior-friendly. I would, however, recommend to younger friends and relatives."

Overall was a seemless process, well organized and a great option for test- and-go. Hotel is in one of the best locations in the city but my room was super quiet."

But the room was not ready and the front desk told me it would be several hours late. This was extremely frustrating since I was traveling and needed to have a work conference call. The rooms need to cleaned, accounted and assigned on time. If not, there should be back up plans for travelers, especially ones that may need to work, are tired, or need to shower. The staff also did not enforce other guests to wear masks. This was very scary. I stayed over a week and saw many guests walking around in the lobby, gym, pool, hallways and elevators without wearing masks. I neither saw nor heard any staff member ask these guests to put on masks. Guests were sneezing and coughing without wearing masks, yet the hotel staff didn't do anything. The staff also wasn't very observant."

I had a drink up at the sky bar and thought it was also very well done with great views. The buffet breakfast had a good selection and was well organised. If I had to criticise anything it would be that we could hear running water from other rooms when they showered etc, not sure of the extent of the issue in other rooms though. Overall though it was excellent value with helpful staff and I would stay there again"

It's a pity it is off the road from Asok BTS. Taxi was not an option for us cause I don't like to entertain mafia taxi driver who likes to rip tourist off. The traffic also make taxi ride rather impossible. The foot path to the Asok BTS was block by illegally parked cars, food stalls which force us to drag our luggage on narrow car road. Well, can't blame Novotel, bad governance by the authorities on urban planning. However, such inconvenience will affect my decision to stay at Novotel again. Next time in BKK, I will choose a hotel besides BTS or MRT. Those who don't mind such inconvenience, Novotel is a nice hotel to stay."

When I arrived I was driven straight to a Covid testing centre and took my PCR test without having to leave the car. I was given my day 5 ATK test and driven to the hotel. Check-in was really quick and then I was able to relax. Dinner and breakfast were served to my room and were good quality and filling too. I got my test result in the morning and enjoyed the excellent, on-site coffee shop. Overall a very efficient quarantine experience."

My RT-PCR test was taken the night of my arrival and the results were given to the hotel staff in the early morning hours , however, I was never notified they received the results. An hour prior to checkout, I called the front office to inquire about my test results. I was told they\u2019d check with the hospital and get back to me. Over an hour later, no word from the front desk. I went to lobby to speak with the front desk about the test results and was given the results that showed the hotel had received the results over six prior to me calling the front desk. I fault myself for being cheap by trying to save a few bucks on the whole Test and Go scheme. Be advised!!! Avoid this place if you can!!"

When checked in asked the receptionist how will I know my pcr test redult, the answer was We will call you. They didn't call me.

The rooms are nice, big enough and very clean. Staff are very helpful. My only negative comment would be the breakfast. I only bothered once. The coffee was very good, poached eggs cooked perfectly but the \u2018meat\u2019 was rather limited. 1 small piece of streaky bacon was all I was given. Looking around, the fellow diners, who were just using the restaurant rather than staying there, the quality of their food looked so much better & plentiful. I would rather pay a bit more & get a bit more meat to be honest. I would recommend the hotel though!"

Food delivery times! Weekdays the serve abf at 9.30 am and then on sunday they come at 7.45?? Also food was hideous! Cold - small 3. Room dirty - no day curtain even rail is there - old and used up - moldy. I asked to change room but could not! It was terrible! If you are in quarantine- the room and food becomes 10x more important! I would even have paid for an upgrade! I spent my last quarantine 14 days in the le meridian and it was absolutely luxury - compared to this experience!

Reception and the most wonderful of the hotel's friendly staff. Quick procedures for receiving and handing over rooms. Nice spacious clean rooms with great furniture and decor. Very comfortable big bed. A spacious bathroom, complete with everything a guest needs, as well as a bidet. Tried the breakfast a few times and it was excellent. I recommend this hotel for visitors to Bangkok. Excellent price for quality and service. Thank you to all the employees we have contacted with for their kind treatment."

It was a haven after the chaos of Phuket going into lockdown. Everything was perfect, with a great breakfast, fab room, and the staff even organised to have our pre-ordered custom suit delivered to the hotel in 45 minutes - we had surrendered this issue in the chaos as low priority to organise postage back to Australia later. Thank you to the staff for your kindness and professionalism. I\u2019ll be back to spend more time in the temples of Bangkok using this as my base."

BTS is just right in front of the hotel. The hotel breakfast is worth for money. Do remember to include breakfast when you book the room. There's a 7-11 and some cafes behind the hotel.

Ok it was a cheaper room as we would not be there for breakfast and they did give us a room when we got there but not the room I had paid for and they didn\u2019t make us change rooms but that\u2019s convenient for them as they don\u2019t have to make up both rooms was not happy with this"

Very limited hours for appetizer and cocktail. Basic well brands and below average hot snacks. Many times the bottles were empty, no drink glasses available, forks gone......and so on. The staff was sweet and wonderful, so most likely a senior management issue. I suggest a Marriott brand for a true exec club experience. Breakfast was pretty good. I might return for the right price . That rate would be $80 max"

It's a stone's throw away from the BTS station, and there's a 7-eleven, Starbucks, McD's just within 3 mins walking distance. The service was great, rooms were spacious - very good usage of space. Beds were super comfy - they even had a pillow menu where you get to choose which pillows you'd like to use during your stay, and believe me, we tried quite a few because pillow comfort is something very important to us. The breakfast had a good variety and decent - the only thing is that you do need to go pretty early as it can get pretty packed during peak hours (between 9am & 10am), but there are signs informin you of this too. All in all, we had a very enjoyable stay and are already planning our next visit."

With the addition of the new building, BS Grand, the front desk service and condition of the old Premier Wing is very poor. The lobby of the new hotel is beautiful, however, only one receptionist was on duty when the shuttle bus arrived from the airport. With 5 people in front of us, we waited well over 45 min to check-in. Adding vaccination apps to phones and taking pictures slowed the check-in process down. Since we arrived from a nearby city by car, we did not need Thai Pass procedures. In the past, there were 2 people on duty when a shuttle bus arrived. The pools and Premier Restaurant are closed. The view from our Premier room was the old pool filled with green slime. We went into the new pool. A staff member chased us out; the pool was closed because they are a Test & Go hotel. There was no sign saying the pool was closed. The hallways of the Premier Wing were un-swept with debris strewn about. Empty plastic crates blocked easy access to the lift. Dishes with congealed food by a neighbouring room were left outside the door for several hours. The floor of the lift was very dirty. To order dinner, we were told to order at reception and it would be brought to tables outside the lobby. Over half an hour later, still no food. The kitchen did not receive our order. We left to find a meal nearby. Although we had planned plenty of time for a meal and shower before leaving for the airport, that time was cut short. We then had to rush. The only plus side of our stay was that the Superior Room was the same cleanliness and comfort as before. As regular Suvarnabhumi travellers, we will be finding another airport hotel. It is so sad to see that an SHA++ upgrade resulted in a downgrade of service."

But.... there is a phone I your room that you need to use to contact the lobby by dialing 0. The don't like picking up the phone and actually just hang up as quick as they can. Which made me decide to call and call and call again until they do pickup. That made them turn off the phone instead of picking up. I was in the need of medical assistance but got fully ignored by the people at yhe lobby. Whe I confronted the staff about this they just laughed and said, did not want to phone.... Exceptionally bad staff!"

When you buy you room it says free breakfast on all rooms which when we arrived never got. So like I said, we like this hotel since it is close to the airport. We have stayed at all but enjoy this place, but they need to pay attention to customers needs. \"GOOD LUCK!\""

The staff did not mention earlier before my travel date so I can decide what to do. The PCR test isn't taken in hotel but in hospital instead. The entire arrangement isn't convenient enough. No meals will be given, only 2 bottle of drinking water provided during my stay, no drinking water for second day. Waited PCR test result for so long, even ridiculous, the staff called me and asked me whether when I would like to checkout, then I have to tell them where is my PCR result, only then they gave me the result. What the? I've been waiting for so long. I can't even go out to get food or drinks due to the fact I'm under quarantine."

The hotel struggled to deal with Room Service orders, as we were not allowed to leave the room. It took almost 3 hours to get some food and drink, although when it arrived it was very good. After we got our negative test results we were able to have a walk around the local area that has some markets and shops. The hotel provided us with a free mini-bus transfer back to the airport for our domestic flight to Koh Samui the next morning."

I told him that we are not going to sleep with cockroaches and asked for refund. He told that Agoda -bookings are non-refundable and insisted us to try another room.

We left the hotel to check out the area to find a heavily Indian populace. Really odd. Later on we found out that everything closes at around 1 so our timing was to blame. Do not drink the water in the fridge, drink the fancy looking bottle on the counter which apparently is the free one. haha."

Have stayed here many times, but now I find as good or better rooms more convenient to the main roads. I am not fond of the owners, they seem not to care about guest and never speak to you, only the people from their homeland. Very uppidy ."

It's in a pretty quiet street, soi 2m, no 7/11 or massage shops next door which is OK. The staff were helpful and if you wanted a tuk tuk to the top of the street then you just had to ask or give them a call to pick you up. This is not a place to impress your girlfriend at, it's all a bit spartan and the reception is very small and unimposing which I guess is OK but no problem having a guest. The room was fine but spartan. It's a place to sleep as opposed to party but it was quiet and surprisingly quiet. Breakfast was not bad, staff will cook you bacon and eggs - the bacon is some of the BEST I have had in Thailand. There is a selection of basic breakfast things, croissant and bread not great quality but OK. The one UNFORGIVABLE thing though is there was no coffee, only instant muck. Amazing. This hotel is fine as a simple and cheap option."

Complementary breakfast was awful with very limited food items, the lady in the kitchen couldn't able to communicate in English so we had to talk to the reception every morning. Location of the hotel was good away from busy places like pubs & night streets as we traveled with young children.
